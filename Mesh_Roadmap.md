# Mesh Product Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the milestones required to evolve the **Mesh** portion of the project into a production ready social platform. Mesh combines collaborative rooms, AI powered nodes and multimedia interactions.

## Goals
- Enable real‑time collaborative "rooms" where users can drag nodes, chat and share media.
- Support custom node workflows powered by LLM instructions.
- Provide engaging social discovery features tailored to user interests.

## Phases

### 1. Foundation
- **User Authentication** – leverage existing auth flows; ensure room membership and permissions.
- **Room Management** – CRUD API for rooms, join/invite links and private/public settings.
- **Basic Node Canvas** – implement React Flow canvas for multiplayer editing; persist nodes and edges to backend.
- **Core Node Types** – text node, media upload node, livestream node (display an iframe or player), link node.
- **Feed Integration** – allow posting completed room outputs (e.g., images or text) to a global feed.

### 2. Social Discovery Engine
- **Interest Profiles** – users specify interests; store in database for personalized content suggestions.
- **Recommendation API** – suggest rooms and posts based on interests, trending topics and social graphs.
- **Search and Explore** – keyword search across rooms, users and posts with filters for interests and media type.

### 3. Advanced Node Workflows
- **LLM Instruction Nodes** – users create node chains with custom instructions that define AI behaviour.
- **State Machine Builder** – visual interface to connect instruction nodes, conditionals and data sources.
- **Photowall Node** – accepts multiple images and outputs a mosaic/grid. Provide shareable permalink for the resulting wall.
- **Webpage Portfolio Node** – collect media and text into a single page that can be published or exported.
- **DAW/Audio Nodes** – integrate existing audio tool endpoints to support music workflow output.

### 4. Real‑Time Collaboration Enhancements
- **Multiplayer Cursors** – show other participants' cursors and selections.
- **Live Chat & Reactions** – persistent chat alongside the canvas with emoji reactions.
- **Live Streaming Support** – livestream node streams video to participants; integrate with existing WebRTC / Twilio API.
- **Concurrency Handling** – optimistic UI updates with conflict resolution for simultaneous edits.

### 5. Production Hardening
- **Scalability Tests** – benchmark room size limits and media upload throughput.
- **Security Review** – validate auth, ACLs and rate limits for real‑time endpoints.
- **Mobile Responsiveness** – ensure room canvas and chat work across devices.
- **Analytics & Metrics** – track usage of rooms, nodes and social discovery features to guide iteration.

### 6. Launch & Growth
- **Onboarding Flow** – tutorial room and example nodes to demonstrate possibilities.
- **Template Gallery** – starter rooms such as Photo Wall, Portfolio Builder and Livestream Event.
- **Feedback Loop** – collect user feedback via in‑app surveys and analytics to prioritize improvements.

By following these phases, Mesh can evolve into a flexible platform that blends social discovery, live collaboration and AI‑driven creation.
