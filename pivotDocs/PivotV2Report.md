Below is a structured design‑review that tries to keep three lenses in focus:

* **Player experience** – what feels confusing, arbitrary, or too easy once the “trick” is found.
* **Puzzle theory** – how the underlying state‑space and information flow affect difficulty and replay‑value.
* **Implementation** – concrete hooks and code patterns that make the improvements practical in your React/TS stack.

## 1 Where the current design feels uneven

| Phase        | Symptoms                                                                                         | Root cause (mechanics)                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Opening**  | *“I don’t know where to start.”* All eight spokes are random noise; no partial feedback.         | No gradients of information. With 4 rings × 8 columns = 32 unknowns but no hint system, the branching factor is huge (8⁴ = 4096 orientations).                                                 |
| **Mid‑game** | Once any one spoke is solved the rest tumble quickly; difficulty collapses.                      | A single correct spoke fixes **all four rings’ absolute offsets** because every ring has the same length (8) and rotations are independent. The search space instantly shrinks from 4096 to 1. |
| **Meta**     | Some puzzles are trivial out of the gate; others are practically impossible inside the spin cap. | Generator does not measure *information content* or *solution uniqueness*.                                                                                                                     |

## 2 Tuning the state space

> **Goal:** Keep the puzzle *deterministic* (no RNG after the first move) but ensure it requires several deductions, not one lucky guess.

### 2.1 Break the symmetrical 8‑8‑8‑8 group

*Use co‑prime ring sizes.*
Let the ring lengths be 9‑8‑7‑6 (or 10‑9‑8‑7 if you still want 45° steps on the outer ring).

* Why it helps – a single solved spoke no longer fixes all ring orientations. It only pins the *relative* offset of the rings whose sizes share a factor; the others still have multiple possibilities.
* Code impact – `step = 360 / letters.length` already handles arbitrary sizes; only art assets (circles) need updating.

### 2.2 Constrain motion to add planning

Two classic options:

| Variant   | How it works                                                                                              | Strategic effect                                                                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Gears** | Rotating ring *k* also rotates ring *k + 1* by the same (or opposite) amount, like meshed gears.          | Player plans chain reactions; parity matters.                                              |
| **Locks** | When a column becomes a valid word, its four letters “lock”. Any further rotation must preserve the lock. | Each success makes the remaining puzzle smaller but *tighter*, extending difficulty curve. |

Add a simple boolean mask per column in state (`locked[i]`).  Before applying a rotation, test whether it would break any `locked` column; if so, disallow or warn.

### 2.3 Guarantee single‑solution puzzles with a difficulty score

Inside `generatePuzzle()`:

1. **Pick target words** with pair‑wise low letter overlap (minimise accidental early solves).
2. **Construct** the four rings by reading the target matrix row‑wise and then adding a random *scramble rotation* per ring.
3. **Search** with DFS/BFS from the scrambled state to verify that:

   * Exactly one orientation vector solves the grid.
   * The shortest solution path (rotations where each move is ±1 on one ring) is ≥ *X* and ≤ *Y* (e.g. 10 ≤ moves ≤ 25).
4. Return rings plus the difficulty metadata.

Caching the pre‑computed shortest path lets you:

* Display “Par: 14 spins” for golfers.
* Reject puzzles that would be impossible under your global `SPIN_LIMIT`.

A plain JavaScript BFS over `8⁴` or `9*8*7*6 ≈ 3024` states is trivial (<1 ms).

## 3 Information & feedback loops

### 3.1 Soft guidance instead of binary green/red

| Feedback flavour                                                                                                          | Implementation                                                                                                    | Pay‑off                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Heat map** on each column showing how many dictionary words are *still possible* given its current pattern (`_ A _ R`). | Pre‑compute a trie of 4‑letter words. Each rotation updates counts in O(8×4).                                     | Players learn to reason probabilistically instead of brute‑forcing.                              |
| **Ring entropy meter**                                                                                                    | For each ring, compute Shannon entropy of its current letter distribution across unsolved columns; display a bar. | Encourages players to rotate the ring that reduces uncertainty the most – a natural *heuristic*. |

Both are client‑side only; no back‑end calls.

### 3.2 Progressive hint economy

* After **N** failed spins, allow the player to *peek* at a single letter (deduct 1 bonus point).
* After **M** more spins, show whether any ring is currently in its correct orientation (“cold/warm/hot”).

Keeps novices engaged without dumbing‑down the core mechanics.

## 4 Scoring that rewards depth

| Component         | Formula (example)                                                                                     | Rationale                                                 |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Efficiency**    | `score_base = par_moves / actual_moves`                                                               | Classic par system.                                       |
| **Style**         | +1 per consecutive “perfect column” streak (solving ≥2 columns back‑to‑back without other rotations). | Rewards foresight.                                        |
| **Entropy bonus** | +log₂(initial\_states / states\_after\_first\_move)                                                   | Mathematically rewards tackling the *hardest* ring first. |

Persist the best score per puzzle in `localStorage` and show a share‑link with URL hash `#id:score` for social virality.

## 5 Code‑level refactor touch‑points

| Current pattern                                              | Suggested refactor                                                                                                                            | Benefit                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Multiple `useState` for each ring (`r1…r4`, `angle1…angle4`) | `const [rings, setRings] = useState<RingState[]>(initial)` where `RingState = { letters: string[]; angle: number }`.                          | Fewer handlers; rotations become `ringIndex => dir`.                                          |
| Re‑computing `rotateSteps` on every render                   | Store current **offset** (0–len‑1) instead of angle in degrees; rotate with modular arithmetic, then derive SVG rotation as `offset*stepDeg`. | Eliminate rounding errors (`Math.round(angle/45)`) and floating‑point drift after many spins. |
| `speed` hard‑wired                                           | Tie spin animation duration to `spinsThisMove × 50 ms`                                                                                        | Faster early exploration, satisfying final “click”.                                           |
| Dictionary as `Set<string>`                                  | Keep a **trie** plus a `Map<pattern, count>` cache for heat‑map feedback                                                                      | O(1) pattern lookup.                                                                          |

## 6 Variant modes for longevity

1. **Daily Puzzle** – same seed for everyone; global leaderboard (hash the solved state as proof).
2. **Time‑Attack** – unlimited spins but a ticking clock; each rotation costs 2 s.
3. **Blindfold** – hide solved columns; player must *know* they are right before hitting “Check”.

Minimal code changes: just parameterise the reducer that counts spins / seconds / hints.

---

## 7 Why this feels mathematically richer

* Co‑prime ring lengths create a non‑trivial group $C_{n_1}\times C_{n_2}\times C_{n_3}\times C_{n_4}$.
* Lock or gear constraints introduce *sub‑groups* and cosets, forcing the player to reason about equivalence classes rather than raw offsets.
* Entropy‑based hints mirror the information theory of Mastermind, giving players a natural entry point to optimal‑search thinking.

### TL;DR—Checklist to try first

1. **Change ring sizes** to 9‑8‑7‑6 and regenerate puzzles with a single‑solution BFS filter.
2. **Add a lock mechanic**: correctly solved columns freeze.
3. **Show soft feedback** (possible‑word count per column).
4. **Publish par scores** and track best‑of‑day.

That four‑step patch alone turns the experience from “poke until lucky” into a layered deduction game whose optimal play is genuinely engaging to master.
