Love the prompt. Here’s a paranoid, comparison‑proof playbook: a set of features/policies that (a) build on Mesh’s existing architecture, (b) create new atomic units incumbents don’t already have, (c) ship with minimal code for max effect, and (d) are hard to wave away with “X already does that.” I’ve grouped them by theme and, for each, included: what it is → why it’s different → MVP spec → abuse/safety → success metric. Where relevant, I anchor ideas to your current modules (Rooms/Sheaf/Flows/SwapMeet/Prediction/Passport) so these aren’t moonshots but extensions of what you’ve shipped.

A) Resolution & Authoring (turn talk into durable outcomes)
1) GitChat: Proposals → Compare → Merge + Merge Receipts
* New unit: a mergeable message with a signed Merge Receipt (hash of chosen facet + author + timestamp).
* Why different: Slack/Discord have threads; Notion has versions; none provide a merge primitive inside chat with cryptographic receipts you can share.
* MVP: you already have proposals & compare. Add a merge_receipts table storing {messageId, versionHash, mergedBy, mergedAt, fromFacetIds[], signature} signed with Mesh Passport keys; render a read‑only Compare page with “v3 / merged by @X” badge that unfurls beautifully anywhere. 
* Safety: rate‑limit merges; audit trail visible to room mods.
* Metric: % messages with ≥1 proposal; proposal→merge rate; external Compare link CTR.
2) Agreement Locks & Acks
* New unit: a lockable decision (post‑merge) with participant acknowledgements.
* Why different: “Approvals” exist in enterprise suites, but not as a natural ending to chat debates with provenance & read‑only share links.
* MVP: agreements {id, messageId, versionHash, lockedBy, lockedAt} + agreement_ack {agreementId, userId, ackAt}; tiny lock card auto‑posted into the thread.
* Safety: only owner/mods may lock; unlock requires quorum or a new merge.
* Metric: locks/week; ack coverage (% participants who acknowledged).
3) Transclusions (Live Embeds)
* New unit: a live‑embedded message that updates everywhere it’s embedded (across rooms, site posts, even external read‑only pages).
* Why different: Twitter cards and Slack unfurls are static; transclusions give you a living source‑of‑truth spread across contexts.
* MVP: transclusion {id, sourceMessageId, targetContextId, createdBy}; render an <iframe>/widget that subscribes to the source via Supabase channel and reflows on update.
* Safety: permission checks on source visibility; “view as” explains what changed.
* Metric: # of transclusions/message; update propagation latency.

B) Interop & Distribution (be the meta‑layer, not another silo)
4) Universal Inbox v1 (RSS + ActivityPub + Email)
* New unit: a cross‑network thread with origin + reply‑out.
* Why different: Most “integrations” are one‑way or siloed. You unify inbound and outbound with provenance and per‑item “Reply As”.
* MVP: BridgeCursor + origin fields on messages; endpoints to add sources, list inbox, and reply‑out. Your Flowstate blocks can automate pull/summarize/post. 
* Safety: signed Identity Map; origin rate limits; spam heuristics.
* Metric: % DAUs with ≥1 external source; reply‑out rate; digest opens.
5) Digest Composer (Reader → Site Post → Email)
* New unit: a curated digest (Mesh Site Post) generated from your sources.
* Why different: Substack/Medium newsletters, but native to your Rooms/Sheaf and cross‑posted out with one click.
* MVP: wizard that takes Inbox items → writes an Article/Site Post + optional email send; public URL unfurls with your brand. 
* Safety: attribute sources by default; honor robots/noindex.
* Metric: digest creation rate; non‑member CTR on digest links.
6) Onion Relay & Censorship‑Resilient Mirrors (opt‑in)
* New unit: a relay‑origin post labeled origin:"onion" with a mirrored, signed read‑only page.
* Why different: Consumer‑friendly doorway to Tor‑sourced publishing with guardrails; platforms rarely provide this responsibly.
* MVP: token‑gated /api/bridges/onion/ingest; “Mirror as onion” for a Room/User with delayed publish + k‑anonymity batches; quarantine lens by default.
* Safety: hash‑lists; moderator queue before public distribution; jurisdiction toggles.
* Metric: # onion ingests approved; zero illegal‑content incidents.

C) Discovery & Agency (algorithm you can hold in your hand)
7) User‑Programmable Views + View Marketplace v1
* New unit: a shareable feed definition (JSON pipeline) that can be opened as a page.
* Why different: Bluesky has feeds; you add a visual node editor (React‑Flow UI you already use) + marketplace + explainability. 
* MVP: views {id, ownerId, json, public} + worker that evaluates the pipeline server‑side or in a Web Worker; “Why shown” per card.
* Safety: sandboxed functions (no network/file access); rate caps.
* Metric: # saved views; subscribers/view; “tune” interactions.
8) Execution Capsules (“Explain Cards”)
* New unit: a signed execution receipt for a view result: hash(viewJSON + inputs).
* Why different: Not “trust us” ranking—provable deterministic output for a given view.
* MVP: run views in a Wasm/Worker; output {result, proofHash}; render “Verify” that recomputes client‑side.
* Safety: cap inputs; size limits; safelisted ops only.
* Metric: verify clicks; % cards verified without mismatch.

D) Commerce & Collective Intelligence (events that travel)
9) Pop‑Up Auctions inside posts/rooms
* New unit: a timeboxed live auction object bound to a message, with recap cards.
* Why different: Whatnot/IG Live are separate contexts; you run it in the thread with portable recap artifacts.
* MVP: auction {id, messageId, startsAt, endsAt, reserve, status} + bid {auctionId, userId, amount}; LiveKit tile optional; recap card auto‑posts after close. You already have stalls/offers/escrow rails. 
* Safety: escrow holds; steward oversight; simple AML/KYC gates if fiat.
* Metric: bidders/auction; GMV; recap share CTR.
10) Forecast Threads (markets anchored to debates)
* New unit: a market‑backed post with resolution notes + attribution.
* Why different: Polls everywhere; markets almost nowhere, especially inside threads with mergeable summary.
* MVP: on any message: “Start forecast” → creates LMSR market (you have this); inline slider to trade; resolution log + payout. 
* Safety: start in credits; money markets by region.
* Metric: participants/market; forecast→resolution retention lift.

E) Trust, Moderation & Provenance (compliance as a feature)
11) Mesh Passport v1 (Right‑to‑Exit + Verifier)
* New unit: a signed export bundle + public verifier page.
* Why different: Big platforms have “export” but no portable, verifiable proof of authorship across posts/graph.
* MVP: Ed25519 keys per user; export ZIP (profile, follows, post hashes); publish a verifier page that validates signatures. 
* Safety: rotate keys with device binding; publish revocation list.
* Metric: exports/week; verifier runs; PR/press mentions (trust).
12) Policy‑as‑Code + Signed Policy Hash
* New unit: a versioned policy contract with on‑chain/anchored hash and UI diff on change.
* Why different: No “blog post updates.” Users see and verify exact changes.
* MVP: sign policy JSON; expose /trust with current hash and diffs; automate anchoring on deploy.
* Safety: red‑flag diff alerts for users; 7‑day veto window optional.
* Metric: trust page visits; policy diffs viewed; community feedback rate.
13) Layered Moderation Lenses + Civic Juries
* New unit: a stackable lens (Wasm) users/rooms choose; juries for hard cases.
* Why different: Platform dictates policy elsewhere; you delegate with transparency and user choice.
* MVP: store lens metadata; apply as a pipeline before render; jury protocol for flagged content above threshold. 
* Safety: platform baseline for legal compliance sits below overlays.
* Metric: lens adoption; reversal rate after jury; time‑to‑decision.
14) Derivative Graph & Attribution
* New unit: a graph of derivations/transclusions between posts (A → remixed into B).
* Why different: TikTok stitches are opaque; you provide structured provenance across Rooms, Sites, and outside embeds.
* MVP: derivative_edge {srcId, dstId, kind: "remix"|"quote"|"transclusion"}; show trail on each post; optional royalty tips later.
* Safety: opt‑out/permissions; DMCA pipeline ties in.
* Metric: # edges/post; attribution click‑throughs; tip volume (later).

F) Memory & Recall (make past work compounding)
15) Collections & /recall (powered by Stars/Bookmarks)
* New unit: a shareable collection (board) that can be summoned inline: /recall billing decisions.
* Why different: Saves exist; summonable boards inside threads do not.
* MVP: turn your Stars/Bookmarks into named collections; “open as page” and insert a live card into the current thread.
* Safety: per‑item visibility; redaction respected.
* Metric: recall insertions/week; collaboration actions spawned.

“Already exists?” stress tests
Use these five tests to filter any idea before you build:
1. Atomic unit: Is there a new object we can export/share/embed (receipt, view, lens, auction recap, passport)?
2. Distribution: Does it create a public URL / embed that looks great elsewhere?
3. Compounding: Does usage make future usage easier (history, network, provenance)?
4. Incumbent asymmetry: Would copying require incumbents to change incentives (e.g., show explainability, allow right‑to‑exit)?
5. Minimal lift: Can we ship a V1 by extending Rooms/Sheaf/Flows/SwapMeet/Prediction you already have? (If not, cut or defer.) 

Micro‑specs (Prisma/API) for a few high‑leverage units
Merge Receipts
model MergeReceipt {
  id           String   @id @default(cuid())
  messageId    BigInt
  versionHash  String   // hash of chosen facet content
  fromFacetIds String[] @db.Text
  mergedBy     BigInt
  mergedAt     DateTime @default(now())
  signature    String   // Ed25519 over (messageId, versionHash, mergedAt, mergedBy)
  @@index([messageId, mergedAt])
}
* POST /api/proposals/merge → writes MergeReceipt + posts a merge note.
Transclusions
model Transclusion {
  id             String  @id @default(cuid())
  sourceMessageId BigInt
  targetContextId String  // roomId | sitePostId | externalPageToken
  createdBy      BigInt
  createdAt      DateTime @default(now())
  @@index([sourceMessageId])
}
* POST /api/transclusions → creates; widget subscribes to source via realtime.
Views & Execution Proofs
model ViewDef {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  ownerId   BigInt
  name      String
  json      Json
  public    Boolean  @default(false)
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
}
model ViewProof {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  viewId    String
  inputHash String
  outputHash String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  @@index([viewId, createdAt])
}
* POST /api/views/run → returns {items, proofHash}; client can “Verify”.
Derivative Graph
model DerivativeEdge {
  srcId BigInt
  dstId BigInt
  kind  String   // "remix" | "quote" | "transclusion"
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  @@id([srcId, dstId, kind])
}
Bridge Cursor (interop)
model BridgeCursor {
  id        BigInt   @id @default(autoincrement())
  userId    BigInt
  protocol  String   // RSS|ActivityPub|ATProto|Email|Onion|Imageboard
  source    String   // feed URL, acct@host, listId...
  cursor    String?
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
  @@index([userId, protocol, source])
}
* POST /api/bridges/sources | GET /api/bridges/inbox | POST /api/bridges/publish. 

Anti‑abuse & legal “tripwires” baked in
* Quarantine by source: imageboards/onion always enter through a quarantine lens; human moderation required to graduate to public.
* Signed provenance on actions: merge receipts, policy hashes, and passport exports reduce “he said/she said” and anchor trust.
* Right‑to‑exit always visible: export & verify buttons on profile/room pages—turns trust into a demo.
* No‑surveillance defaults: first‑party analytics; “Why shown” on feed cards; view JSON is inspectable. 

What to build next (90‑day, comparison‑proof)
1. Ship Compare links + Merge Receipts + Agreement Locks (read‑only pages + unfurls).
2. Universal Inbox (RSS/AP/email) + Digest Composer (Flowstate blocks included). 
3. Pop‑Up Auctions (message‑bound; recap cards). 
4. Programmable Views v1 + Explain Cards (verify button). 
5. Transclusions + Derivative Graph (live embeds + provenance).
6. Passport v1 + Policy‑as‑Code (/trust page with signed hash & diffs). 
This sequence maximizes unique, shareable artifacts (Compare, Recaps, Digests, View pages, Passport proofs) that travel across the web and pull people back—very hard for incumbents to copy without rewriting incentives.
If you want, I can turn any two of these into ready‑to‑apply diffs next (my vote: Merge Receipts + Compare pages, and Universal Inbox + Digest Composer).
