Below is a “menu of options” you can pick‑and‑choose from while designing two distinct settings surfaces:

Profile settings – visible to every registered user and scoped to their own experience.

Site / workspace settings – visible only to administrators, moderators, or owners.

For each surface I list (1) foundational must‑haves (users expect these everywhere) and (2) differentiators that lean into the unique vision you’ve been describing (algorithmic transparency, point economy, hypermedia, etc.).
Use the differentiators as inspiration—implement only those that fit your current roadmap.

1. Profile‑level settings (for every user)
Category	Must‑have controls	Differentiators you could add
Account & identity	• Display name, @handle, profile photo, bio	
• Email & phone		
• Multi‑factor auth / passkey		
• Delete / deactivate account	• Pseudonym tiers – let users publish under real name, pseudonym, or “faceless” and switch per‑post	
• Life‑story time‑capsule toggle (locks certain posts from comment/edit)		
Privacy & visibility	• Public / followers‑only / private profile	
• Block & mute lists		
• Who can tag / DM	• Per‑field visibility matrix – sliders for each section of profile (e.g., followers see age, public sees city)	
• Search discoverability dial – % chance your content enters “Explore”		
Content & feed	• Language filters	
• Sensitive‑media warnings		
• Autoplay / sound defaults	• Algorithm slider stack – expose key signals (quality rating, novelty, similarity, creator diversity) that users can weight 0‑100% in real time	
• OCEAN self‑calibration game – run the BuzzFeed‑style quiz once, then show a heat‑map of how each trait currently shapes their feed, plus a “nudge me” toggle to gradually broaden horizons		
Notifications	• Channels (push, email, SMS)	
• Digest schedule		
• Mentions vs. all replies	• Mood‑aware quiet hours – users set “flow” windows where only high‑importance notifications slip through (backed by simple ML or calendar integration)	
Appearance & accessibility	• Dark/light/system theme	
• Font size		
• Reduced‑motion	• Viewport presets for creators – simulate how their posts look on different aspect ratios / color‑blind modes right inside settings	
Monetization & earnings	• Payout method	
• Tax / W‑9 info	• Creator “IPO” dashboard – show eligibility progress bar (12 videos, ≥5/10 rating, 3‑month tenure), forecast token price if they went public now	
Data & security	• Download my data (ZIP)	
• Revoke third‑party apps		
• Session list	• Snapshot & roll‑back – one‑click restore of profile to any previous day (versioned JSON diff)	
Advanced / developer	• API keys	
• Webhooks	• Graph schema preview – visualize how their content nodes link to others (powered by your React Flow backend)	

2. Site‑/workspace‑level settings (admins & owners)
Category	Must‑have controls	Differentiators you could add
Brand & basics	• Name, logo, color palette	
• Default language / locale		
• Domain & DNS	• Dynamic theming tokens – admins upload a design‑token JSON; entire UI recompiles live (great demo of your three.js / shader pipeline)	
User management	• Invite, suspend, remove	
• Role & permission matrix	• Reputation quorum for mod actions – community vote threshold (e.g., 250 flags) before admin review, adjustable per content type	
Content governance	• Community guidelines editor	
• Default content retention (ephemeral vs. permanent)	• Algorithm policy sandbox – sliders that tune global weighting for “quality”, “recency”, “risk”; instantly see simulated feed outcomes with test accounts	
Economy & monetization	• Stripe / banking keys	
• Platform fee %	• Anti‑siphonomics dashboard – set decay rate for point → cash conversion, manage inflation schedule, view Gini coefficient over time	
Security & compliance	• SSO / SCIM integrations	
• Audit log export	• Knowledge provenance ledger – toggle blockchain‑backed semantic verification (“Alethosphere”) for selected knowledge posts	
Integrations	• Webhooks	
• OAuth app directory	• Live‑embedding hooks – choose which vector DB provider indexes which content lanes; enable/disable per cohort	
Analytics	• MAU / retention	
• Top content, churn reasons	• Emotion‑over‑time heat‑map – aggregated sentiment of comments plotted against algorithm version history	
Experiments / feature flags	• Beta features on/off	• A/B autopilot – admins define success metric; system spins up variants, reports Bayesian probability of win; one‑click promote

3. Cross‑cutting design tips
Progressive disclosure – show essentials first, tuck power‑user options behind “Advanced”.

Real‑time previews – any change (theme, algorithm slider) instantly re‑renders a mini feed mock‑up.

Search‑within‑settings – a global fuzzy‑find bar (“Jump to ‘privacy’”).

Restore defaults & changelog – every panel has “Undo”, and admins see a chronological diff of all settings edits.

Granular permission hooks – every new feature ships with scopes so enterprise customers can lock it down.

Onboarding wizard – first‑time users step through the most impactful settings (privacy, algorithm tuning, notifications) instead of raw list dumping.

Explainers & trust nudges – beside any algorithm or data‑sharing control, add a short “Why this matters” tooltip linking to longer docs.

Where to start if you’re short on time
Phase 1: Ship core tables: Account, Privacy, Notifications, Delete account, and a minimal Admin panel (roles, guidelines).

Phase 2: Add algorithm transparency sliders and the point‑economy dashboard—those are your signature moves.

Phase 3: Layer in fun calibration games, real‑time previews, and versioned roll‑backs.

Treat the lists above as a backlog you can prune or re‑order to match engineering capacity and product narrative.
