### 1 · Gut‑check — why this has legs

| Angle             | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Market gap**    | “Long‑form with polish” is either (a) *paywalled journalism* (NYT, WaPo) or (b) *monetisation‑first newsletters* (Substack, Medium). There is no mainstream venue that lets *anyone* publish a visually rich, magazine‑grade article **without** pushing subscriptions, SEO click‑bait, or ad trackers. |
| **User appetite** | Reddit’s r/ExplainLikeImFive, Hacker News “Show HN” posts, and viral Substack essays show that *when long‑form is well‑formatted and socially discoverable* it travels far.                                                                                                                             |
| **Mesh synergy**  | Mesh already supports multimedia canvases, collaborative editing, and community voting.  An “Article” type can reuse those primitives yet become a marquee showcase of Mesh’s design ethos.                                                                                                             |

**Verdict:** Worth pursuing.  It differentiates Mesh from both *“blogging platforms”* (too siloed) and *“social feeds”* (too ephemeral).

### 2 · Core product principles

| Principle                       | Implication for feature design                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Readability first**           | Default templates must be *typographically excellent* (NYT‑level whitespace, line height, pull‑quotes, footnotes).                                                     |
| **Creator effort ≠ dev effort** | WYSIWYG block editor with opinionated layout presets (“Header + Hero,” “Side‑bar Glossary,” “Conversation Pull‑out”) so great design is *one click*, not CSS tweaking. |
| **Democratic discovery**        | Articles live in the same Mesh vote / comment ecosystem—no paywalls, no follower gating; quality floats via community signals.                                         |
| **Collaborative intelligence**  | Native support for inline comments, suggestion mode, and co‑author credits (fits Mesh “rooms” & “lounges”).                                                            |
| **Portable & durable**          | Every article renders to clean HTML + JSON AST; can be exported or mirrored (if you later decentralise the room).                                                      |

### 3 · Feature brainstorm

### 4 · Risks & mitigations

| Risk                                            | Mitigation                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Low‑effort wall‑of‑text posts still slip in** | Surface *layout quality signals* in ranking (e.g., headings ratio, paragraph length).                         |
| **Feature creep → bloated editor**              | Ship opinionated templates; hide advanced blocks behind “More blocks” drawer.                                 |
| **Performance (large images, embeds)**          | Server‑side image optimisation; lazy‑load embeds; pre‑render skeleton.                                        |
| **Moderation of long‑form misinfo**             | Reuse existing Mesh flagging + link automated LLM fact‑checks to highlight questionable claims for reviewers. |

### 5 · Feasibility snapshot

*Tech stack re‑use*

* Rich‑text: your existing Slate / TipTap blocks from “rooms” comments can be promoted to full‑screen editor.
* Layout: Node‑graph/canvas engine already supports drag‑drop blocks—restrict node types for articles.
* Voting, analytics: reuse standard Mesh feed & analytics pipeline.

**Team‑weeks**: \~3 dev‑weeks for MVP (one full‑stack, one designer), assuming editor foundations exist.

---

### 6 · Go / No‑go checklist

* [ ] User interviews (5‑10 heavy Reddit/Substack writers): “Would you post here if…?”
* [ ] Spike prototype: convert an NYT public article to block spec and render in Mesh—visual parity?
* [ ] Moderation bandwidth forecast: could long‑form increase review queue substantially?

If **≥70 %** positive and tech spike passes, proceed.

## 7 · Next steps → formal SRS & roadmap (outline)

Should you green‑light the concept, here is a concise skeleton for the Software Requirements Specification:

1. **Purpose & scope**
   1.1 Goals, 1.2 Non‑goals.

2. **User personas & stories**
   *E.g.,* “Alex, freelance journalist, wants to publish an investigative piece with interactive charts.”

3. **Functional requirements**
   FR‑01 Block editor, FR‑02 Save draft autosave, FR‑03 Publish workflow, FR‑04 Comment system, FR‑05 Version history.

4. **Non‑functional requirements**
   NFR‑01 Accessibility WCAG 2.1 AA, NFR‑02 Page LCP < 2 s on 4G, NFR‑03 SEO microdata (even if goal isn’t SEO, basic discoverability matters).

5. **System design**
   • Data model (Article, ArticleBlock, Revision, Analytics).
   • APIs (`/api/article/:id`, `/api/article/:id/blocks`).
   • CDN & image optimisation flow.

6. **Security & privacy**
   Draft visibility (unlisted, private, public), XSS sanitisation.

7. **Open questions & risks**

8. **Appendix: UI wireframes**

*Roadmap* would map these to Milestones: MVP, v1.1, v1.2, with rough story points.

I can generate the full SRS template and a packetised implementation playbook (as we did for Room Shards) whenever you give the word.

### 8 · Quick riff‑ideas to chew on

* **“Canonical quotes”** – Let authors link to *other* Mesh articles; hovering shows the quoted block with backlink, fostering a web‑like citation graph.
* **Dynamic TL;DR** – Client‑side summariser that condenses article into 100 words; taps into Mesh’s AI capabilities, helps skimmers.
* **Reading circles** – Post can be “published to Lounge X” where it triggers a guided discussion thread (structured prompts).
* **E‑ink / offline mode** – One‑tap generate `.epub` or “Send to Kindle” for long train rides.

---

### TL;DR

A polished, template‑driven **Article Post Type** fills a real UX void between social threads and paywalled journalism, aligns with Mesh’s strengths, and is technically low‑risk thanks to reusable components.  If the idea energises you, the next concrete deliverable should be an SRS plus a 3‑sprint roadmap—happy to draft both on request.
