## Prioritized Sprint Queue

| Priority | Sprint | Description | Status | Est. Effort |
|----------|--------|-------------|--------|-------------|
| **1** | Academic Agora Dev Roadmap | Create implementation roadmap synthesizing `ACADEMIC_AGORA_HSS_DESIGN.md` + `ACADEMIC_COLLABORATION_FEATURES_BRAINSTORM.md` | 🔜 Next | M |
| **2** | Legal Identity Frame Implementation | Implement platform features from `LEGAL_IDENTITY_FRAME_v3.md` (commitment UI, audit exports, demo mode) | Queued | M-L |
| **3** | Sellars Roadmap P1-3 | Dual characterization models, inference tickets, grounding semantics | Queued | L |
| **4** | Sellars Roadmap P4-6 | Developmental scaffolding, community substrate, picturing layer | Queued | L |
| **5** | Stacks Phase 3.3+ | Continue Stacks feature development as informed by Academic Agora roadmap | Queued | M |

## Parallel Research Track

| Track | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Historical Academic Networks** | Trace evolution of networked academic research over 200 years — changes, innovations, constants, traditions | 🔄 In Progress (parallel) |

## Rationale

### Why Academic Agora Roadmap First?
1. **Strategic leverage**: Rich design docs (2500+ lines combined) need implementation phases
2. **Informs downstream work**: Clarifies which Stacks features, Sellars concepts, and Legal frame elements to prioritize
3. **Builds on momentum**: Library search enhancement connects to Citation Intelligence tier
4. **Concrete output**: Phased implementation plan ready for execution

### Why Legal Identity Frame Second?
1. Production-ready messaging already complete
2. Some features are platform implementations (commitment tracking, audit trails)
3. Demo scripts useful for user testing

### Why Sellars Phases 1-6 Third?
1. Deep philosophical foundation → ambitious platform features
2. Best tackled after academic/legal work clarifies priorities
3. 6 phases spanning ~8000 lines of specification
