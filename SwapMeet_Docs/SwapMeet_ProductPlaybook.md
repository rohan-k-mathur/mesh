Below is a product playbook for a Real‑Time Virtual Flea‑Market module inside Mesh—designed to evoke the serendipity of strolling past physical stalls, striking up conversation, and buying on the spot.I break it down from the user journey through to technical architecture, governance, and a six‑week MVP plan so your team can scope, staff, and sprint.

1 · Core Experience in a Sentence
“Scroll, wander, and haggle in a living 2‑D bazaar where every grid square is a live seller stall—complete with real‑time chat, optional video, and instant checkout—so discovery feels like poking around a Sunday flea market, not hunting SKUs on Amazon.”

2 · Spatial Metaphor & Market Layout
Feature	Purpose	UX Details
Macro‑Grid (“Market Map”)	Replace infinite scrolling with spatial exploration	Infinite (or finite‑ring) grid addressed by (x,y); each coordinate = “section page” containing up to 3 × 3 stalls.
Section Page (“Aisle”)	Screen‑wide canvas of nine clickable stall thumbnails	Arrow buttons (N,E,S,W) & WASD keyboard shortcuts move ±1 section; minimap (bottom‑right) shows current location & heat‑map of activity.
Stall Thumbnail	Teases inventory + presence	1–3 hero photos (auto‑rotate), seller avatar + live badge (🟢 if seller present), #visitors count. Hover = quick description.
Stall Detail View	The immersive micro‑space	Pops as full‑screen overlay or route change. Contents (see §3): live video, item grid, chat, bargaining widgets, checkout panel.
Discovery Balance
* Serendipity First: No algorithmic ranking inside the map—everyone’s stall lives somewhere; foot‑traffic driven by placement + word‑of‑mouth.
* Gentle Guidance: Optional “Teleport” button that jumps you to random busy sections every n minutes (for users who click the wrong way and feel lost).

3 · Inside a Stall
Zone	Component	Interaction
A · Header Bar	Seller name, rating stars, “Follow” button, “Schedule” icon (shows upcoming live sessions)	
B · Main Media Pane	- Live video (WebRTC) if seller is broadcasting. - Fallback: looping product slideshow.	Seller can toggle camera / share screen; buyers allowed 2‑way cam if granted.
C · Item Grid	Cards: photo, price, short desc., stock. Clicking ➜ side‑drawer with full details & “Add to Basket”.	
D · Chat & Presence	Real‑time text; avatar cursors when buyer hovers item (Figma‑style “look where others are looking”).	Emoji reacts & /offer $X slash‑command to open bargaining modal.
E · Dynamic‑Pricing Widgets	- Live Bargain: counter‑offer ladder visible to others. - Flash Auction: start 90‑sec timer, minibids appear.	Optional; seller toggles per item.
F · Checkout Drawer	Cart summary, shipping selector, payment (credit, Apple/Google, on‑chain), receipt email toggle.	Escrow until seller marks shipped.
4 · Roles & Permissions
Role	Abilities	Upgrade Path
Visitor	Browse, chat read‑only	Login ➜ Buyer
Buyer	Chat, offers, pay, rate sellers	3 completed purchases ➜ “Trusted Buyer” badge (reduced escrow hold)
Seller	Create stall, list items, stream, bargain/auction, withdraw funds	Application + KYC
Steward (Market Mod)	Move or hide stalls, mediate disputes	Elected by seller vote + admin approval
5 · Interaction Mechanics
1. Walk‑Up FlowSection → Click Stall → Detail View loads (pre‑join) → auto‑join chat → optional 1‑click “Say hi 👋”.
2. Bargaining
    * Buyer clicks “Make Offer” → modal with price field & message.
    * Seller gets toast: “$25 offer on Vintage Clock (list $30)” → Accept / Counter / Reject.
    * All offers logged in item history for transparency.
3. Flash Auction
    * Seller selects item, hits “Start Auction”, sets reserve & duration (30–300 s).
    * Countdown big & centered; bids update in real time; winner auto‑checked‑out if payment on file.
4. Presence Extras
    * If ≥ 3 buyers in stall & seller present, “Group Bargain” unlocks: collective offer slider; seller can accept group price for n units.
    * Voice proximity (opt‑in): buyers within ±1 section hear ambient stall chatter (low‑volume).

6 · Commerce & Payments
Step	Detail
Escrow Model	Buyer pays upfront; funds held by platform until seller provides tracking or buyer hits “Received & OK”.
Payout Options	ACH, PayPal, Stripe Connect, optional stablecoin.
Fees	Platform takes: x % sale fee + auction surcharge; bargaining offers free.
Disputes	Opens ticket; Steward can view chat/video logs + item photos.
7 · Tech Architecture (Mesh Stack Fit)
graph TD
A(Next.js Frontend) --> B(WebSocket Gateway - Supabase Realtime)
A --> C(WebRTC SFU - LiveKit)
A --> D(Payment API - Stripe)
B --> E(Postgres: stalls, items, offers, coords)
B --> F(Redis PubSub for auctions)
E --> G(Storage (Supabase): images, video thumbnails)
* Navigation: client calculates (x,y) route from URL (/market?x=12&y=‑7).
* Stall sync: Y.js CRDT doc per stall (chat log, offer states) piped through Supabase Realtime.
* Auctions: server‑authoritative timer in Redis; broadcasts current high bid every 200 ms.
Scalability
* Partition grid shards (chunkId = floor(x/10),floor(y/10)) for load‑balanced read replicas.
* Soft cap concurrent viewers per stall (e.g., 200) then auto‑spawn “overflow gallery” mirroring video & chat.

8 · Governance & Safety
Vector	Mitigation
Fraudulent items	Mandatory listing photos + automated reverse‑image check; buyer‑side KYC for high‑ticket.
Harassment in chat/video	“Tap‑to‑flag” clip; AI nudity & hate‑speech classifier; auto‑ghost repeat offenders.
IP infringement	DMCA portal; repeat violators lose seller status.
Over‑crowded grid hot‑spots	Steward can reorder stalls or throttle teleports to preserve foot traffic diversity.
9 · Instrumentation & KPIs
Funnel Stage	Metric
Explore	Avg sections visited / session; dwell time per stall
Engage	Chats sent per stall visit; offer‑to‑view ratio
Convert	Offer acceptance rate; purchase latency
Return	Buyers visiting ≥ 3 sessions / week; seller retention 30‑day
Real‑time heat‑map overlay on minimap visualises section popularity—drives community “where’s the buzz?” moments.

10 · Six‑Week MVP Roadmap
Week	Milestone
1	Static grid navigation (arrow keys, minimap); section pages loading stall thumbnails from DB.
2	Stall detail view w/ item grid, Supabase chat, basic basket checkout (no bargaining).
3	Seller dashboard: list items, start/stop live video (LiveKit SDK).
4	Offer / counter‑offer workflow; escrow integration w/ Stripe Test Mode.
5	Flash auction module (server timer, bid UI); presence avatars & live badge logic.
6	Soft‑launch “Market Day”: onboard 25 beta sellers, run 4‑hour live event; capture metrics + feedback.
11 · Extension Ideas (Post‑MVP)
1. AR View: project stall thumbnails as cards around you (phone camera) for IRL‑style browsing.
2. Theme Days: automatically skin grid (e.g., Retro Games Alley) and cluster similar stalls via tags.
3. Collaborative Booths: two sellers merge stalls for pop‑up collabs.
4. NFT/On‑chain Ticketing: limited‑edition passes for early entry or VIP chat color.
5. Social Presence Layer: see friend avatars on minimap; group walk like an MMO party.

Final Take‑Away
This virtual bazaar keeps Mesh’s “quality + co‑presence” ethos while introducing a concrete revenue engine and a tactile exploration loop. By constraining discovery to a navigable grid—and layering in live negotiation rather than pure auctions—you capture that magical flea‑market feeling of stumbling on a gem and chatting directly with its owner.
Let me know which modules you’d like deeper specs or wireframes for, and I can draft schema diagrams or a component breakdown next.
