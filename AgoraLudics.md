# Ludics

- Each move yields `acts[]` (polarized actions) at an address `locusPath`.
- WHY → negative (expects justification). GROUNDS → positive (provides justification). CLOSE → daimon (†).
- Stepper computes convergence/divergence; UI surfaces via † chips and TraceRibbon.

**Moderator tooling**
- Delocate/fax to resolve clashes (fresh loci).
