A number of argumentation schemes are taken from Bita Banihashemi and Iyad Rahwan's previous version of the AIF ontology. Floris Bex The AIF Ontology. version 1.0 Having to accept case Cn as a precedent, or as a recgnized exception to R would be intolerable (horrid, bad) A is an acceptable action Case C0 is tentatively acceptable as an initial presumption if a contends A, A should be accepted as more (less) plausible The search for knowledge found is adequately compelete. There are alternative means other than B. If an argument A occurs in a context of dialogue that requires a nonarbitrary definition for a key property F that occurs in A, and F is defined in an arbitrary way in A, then A ought to be rejected as deficient. Some property F that occurs in argument A is defined in a way that is arbitrary A is false(true) The penultimate step C(n-1) leads to a horrible outcome, Cn, which is not acceptable. If A is brought about, bad consequences will plausibly occur If C is brought about, bad consequences (D) will plausibly occur It is less likely that a has taken the evidence on both sides of the issue into account If an arguer x is biased, then it is less likely that x has taken the evidence on both sides of an issue into account in arriving at conclusion A The Verbal Classification is based on a stipulative or biased definition that is subject to doubt Arguer a is biased A is true (false) in case C2 In this case, the individual a has property F and also property G A causes B The conditional 'If A then C' is not, by itself, acceptable (nor are any sequences from A to C shorter than the one specified in the second premise) If A0 to An-1 are brought about, An which is a horrible (disastrous, bad) outcome will plausibly occur There exists a series of cases, C0, C1, ..., C(n-1), where each case leads to the next by a combination of causal precedent, and/or analogy steps. There is an intervening sequence of propositions, B1, B2, ..., Bn-1, Bn, C, such that the following conditionals are true: If A then B1; If B1 then B2; ...; If Bn-1 then Bn; If Bn then C For any given pair {ai, aj} of adjacent individuals in the sequence a1, a2, ..., an, individual aj is indistinguishable from ai with respect to F a is a person of bad character Issue of character is relevant in the type of dialouge in which the argument was used For all x, if x has property F, then x can be classified as having property G In this case it was shown that a is committed to proposition A, according to the evidence of what he said or did Commitment to A does not imply commitment to B commitments of a are inconsistent. Generally, when an arguer is committed to A, it can be inferred that he is also committed to B. In this case, a is committed to B Evidence such as poll or appeal to common knowledge supports that A is generally accepted as true. There are other golas that conflict with A There is evidence that supports the claim that these consequences will occur if A is brought about. A has property F a ought to continue trying to realize A There is a positive correlation between A and B E is a credible expert source Certain differences between C1 and C2 tend to undermine the force of similarity cited Either A or C A should be brought about For all x, if doing A is the established rule for x, then (subject to exceptional cases), x must do A (subject to penalty) Doing A is the established rule for a If x is a person of good (bad) moral character, then if x contends A, A should be accepted as more (less) plausible If hypothesis A is true, then a proposition B, reporting an event, will be observed to be true. There exists case C3 that is similar to C1 but in which A is false (true) For all x, if doing A is the established rule for x, then if the case of x is an exception, the rule does not apply to the case of x The case of a is an exception A (a finding) is true in this situation E's assertion is backed up by evidence A is not consistent with other expert assertions If you carry out A, then the negative consequences portrayed in this fearful situation will happen to you. Here is a situation that is fearful to you Source E is an expert in subject domain D containing proposition A. A should not be brought about Either A or C should not be brought about Admitting case C0, or bringing it forward in the first place, is not a good thing to do A is generally accepted as true There are good reasons to doubt A is not true even though it is generally accepted There is evidence that backs up the claim Generally, if x has property F then (usually, probably, typically) x also has property G Bringing about B is the way to bring about A The goal is to bring about A B is generally indicated as true when its sign, A, is true For all x and y, if x has F then, if y is indistinguishable for x with respect to F, then y also has F A has property G a has claimed or indicated that he is committed to proposition A (generally or in virtue of what he said in the past). It is an irrational fear that is appealed to. There are grounds for thinking majority are justified in accepting A E asserts that A is true (false) C is true (false) A is true (false) There are reasons to believe that correlation is more than a coincidence The knowledge is not complete enough to support the argument adequately E is not an honest source Q P -> Q (If P then Q) P a is a person of good (bad) moral character C0 is not acceptable an does not have property F It is not the case that A has property F a need not do A B has been observed to be false in a given instance Argument A occurs in a context of dialogue that requires a nonarbitrary definition for a key property F that occurs in A a must do A (subject to penalty) B has been observed to be true in a given instance In this case, A occurs In this case, B will occur Other evidence in this particular case shows that a is not really committed to A. A (Undesired Action) is the converse of C (Desired Action) There are consequences of the opposite value that ought to be taken into account There is a third factor, C, causing both A and B If A were true (false) , it would be known to be true (false) If A is a popular practice among those familiar with what is acceptable or not with regard to A, that gives a reason to think that A is acceptable If A is a popular practice among those familiar with what is acceptable or not with regard to A, that gives a reason to think that A is acceptable A is a popular practice among those who are familiar with what is acceptable or not with regard to A E is in a position to know whether A is true or false If A is brought about, good consequences will plausibly occur A is true (false) in case C1 Argument A occurs in a context of dialogue that requires a certain level of precision B is true in this situation If A is generally accepted as true, there exists a reason in favour of A If A is not carried out, this will stop the negative consequences from happening There is evidence that indicates doubt on whether A definitly has property F. A0 is up for consideration as a proposal that seems initially like something that should be brought about ~P P credibility of X as a sincere person who believes in his own argument has been put into question A is a realistic goal Bringing up A0 would plausibly lead (in the given circumstances, as far as we know) to A1, which would in turn plausibly lead to A2, and so fourth, through the sequence A2,…,An argument X should not be accepted Other steps are required to fill in the sequence of events to make it plausible AA is a reasonable interpretation of A. The practical inconsistency can be resolved by further dialogue. Case C0 would set a precedent with respect to an existing rule R There is a strong correlation between the sign and the event signified There are other events that more reliably account for the sign Generally, case C1 is similar to case C2 There is a climate of social opinion that once people come to accept each step as plausible (or as accepted practice), they will then be led to accept the next step. There is a strong probability that the cited consequences will occur. a is typical of things that have F and may or may not have G Proposition A is not known to be true (false) If an argument A occurs in a context of dialogue that requires a certain level of precision, but some property F that occurs in A is defined in a way that is too vague to meet the requriements of that level of precision, then A ought to be rejected as deficient. Some property F that occurs in argument A is defined in a way that is too vague to meet the requirement of the level of precision appropriate for the context of dialogue in which A occurs If all a's previous attempts to realize A are wasted, that would be a bad thing If a stops trying to realize A now, all a's previous effors to realize A will be wasted The weakest link in the sequence show one event may not really lead to another Dr. Phil is a credible expert source Expert Opinion Argument 1: Dr. Phil and tipping Dr. Phil's assertion is backed up by evidence The fact that tipping lowers self esteem is not consistent with other expert assertions Dr. Phil is an expert in Psychology Dr. Phil says that tipping lowers self esteem Tipping lowers self esteem Dr. Phil is not an honest source Dr. Phil's assertion is not backed up by evidence Tipping improves self esteem Tipping improves self-esteem Rewarding improves self esteem Generally Tipping is like rewarding Allen says Brazil has the best football team Brazil has the best football team Allen is not an honest source Allen is in position to know about football teams #Analogy_Scheme Scheme for Argument from Analogy #CausalSlipperySlope_Scheme Scheme for Slippery Slope Argument #CircumstantialAdHominem_Scheme Scheme for Circumstantial Ad Hominem Argument #Commitment_Scheme Scheme for Argument from Commitment #ContainsProperty_Statement Main #CorrelationToCause_Scheme Scheme for Argument from Correlation to Cause #Dilemma_Inference Scheme for Argument from Dilemma #DirectAdHominem_Scheme Scheme for Direct Ad Hominem Argument #ExpertOpinion_Scheme Scheme for Argument from Expert Opinion #FearAppeal_Scheme Scheme for Argument from Fear Appeal #GeneralBackUpEvidence_Desc Main #GoalPlan_Statement Main #Goal_Statement Main #I-node I-nodes contain information.
