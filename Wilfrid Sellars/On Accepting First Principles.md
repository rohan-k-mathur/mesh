ON ACCEPTING FIRST PRINCIPLES
Wilfrid Sellars
University of Pittsburgh
My purpose in this essay is to examine the authority of first principles. The first principles Ihall discuss may not have the full stature,
the all-around primacy usually associated with this term. Indeed some
of them would be taken by many to belong to a much lower order,
if they are accepted as 'principles' at all. But principles they are, I
shall argue, and, in a legitimate sense, 'first.'
It is clear that a first principle does not gain its authority by having been derived from premises for the simple reason that, if it did,
they and not it would be 'first.' On the other hand, a first principle
must have authority. Itis as rational beings that we accept them;
it is reasonable to accept them. But what kind of reasonableness might
first principles have? And how can they be shown to have it?
Now the idea of showing or establishing that it is reasonable to
accept a first principle suggests that there is such a thing as reasoning of the following kind
[premises]
Therefore, it is reasonable to accept P,
even when there is no corresponding argument
[premises]
Therefore, P.
Where there is a good argument of the latter kind, there must be
a good argument of the former kind. It is the vice versa that doesn't
hold.

Let us consider this in more detail. Suppose we have an argument
p
If P, then Q
Therefore, Q
For example: If it is day it is light; it is day; therefore it is light. Here
we have a good argument. In the first place it is logically valid. It
is also a good argument in that the premises are true so that, since
it is valid, the conclusion must also be true. Furthermore, it is a good
argument as it stands. No additional premise needs to be
"understood."
On the other hand, intimately related to the above is another argument; something like the following:
Q follows logically from P and if P, then Q
P and if P, then Q are true
Therefore, itis reasonable to accept Q
This time there may well be "understood" premises, or at least definitions. But the major premise is powerful, and surely takes as a long
way towards the conclusion.
The first of the preceding arguments is a good, explicitly valid, argument of which Q is the conclusion. The second argument,hough
closely related, doesn't have as its conclusion Qby itself, but rather
"It is reasonable to accept Q." Nor does its content seem to be quite
as explicit. That there are good arguments of the second kind is clear.
But what is their significance? Should we look them in the face and
then walk on? I want to suggest that a careful study of such arguments
provides the key to the problem with which we began.
Notice, to begin with, that the conclusion of the second argument
says something about the conclusion of the first. Itpats Q on the back,
so to speak, by telling us that it is reasonable to accept it. The conclusion of the first argument, on the other hand, doesn't say that it
is reasonable to accept Q. It simply says Q, though by preceding it
by a "therefore" it implies, in some sense, that it is reasonable to
accept Q.
Now accepting aproposition is, in a broad sense, a doing.1 It is
not a physical doing, but rather amental doing, but it is a doing,
none the less, and, like all doings, is something that can be correctly
or incorrectly done. It is, so to speak, subject to a kind of ethics or
morality, as are all doings. Let us, therefore, consider briefly the

general idea of its being reasonable and proper to do something.
Perhaps, by turning our attention to the ethics of doing in general,
we gain some insight into the ethics of this very special king of doing which is accepting aproposition.
"It is reasonable and proper to do A." What does this mean? Surely something like the following: There is a good and sufficient argument for doing A. What kind of argument? Arguments for doing
something are classically called 'practical' arguments. So, in effect,
we have led to the topic of the practical syllogism. This topic is of
great importance not only for ethics but for a theory of action or
conduct generally. I have no time on the present occasion even to
articulate this topic, let alone touch on the many exciting issues it
involves. Ishall therefore select a simple paradigm and elaborate
it just enough to mobilize your logical and philosophical intuitions
for the use to which I am going to put the concept of a practical
syllogism.
Consider the following piece of reasoning:
Bringing about E implies doing A.
I shall bring about E.
Therefore, I shall do A.
The argument has the ring of validity. Can it be a good argument?
In our earlier discussion we characterized a good argument as one
which is valid and has true premises. In the present case, the major
premise is the sort of thing which can be true. But what of "I shall
bring about E?" If this were a mere prediction, it, too, could be true.
But in the present context it expresses an intention, and it is not clear
that intentions are properly characterized as true or false. I shall,
for the moment at least, simply dodge this issue and assume that
an argument of the above form can be good as well as valid, and
that what makes it good (though not necessarily, of course, morally
good) as opposed to merely valid (as a valid argument with a false
premise is merely valid) is a matter of my actually having the intention to bring about E. There might be a stronger sense of 'good' which
requires that I not only intend to bring about E, but that the bringing about of E has some kind of objective or natural claim on me.
But whether this might be so and if so, in what sense, is not my problem on the present occasion.
Let me call the conclusion of the above argument-"I shall do A"-
its logical outcome. But "I shall do A" expresses an intention. Thus,
This content downloaded from 82.146.40.102 on Sat, 28 Jun 2014 18:09:23 PM

304 / Wilfrid Sellars
if I am persuaded by the argument, I will acquire the intention to
do A. Let me call the acquisition of this intention the practical outcome of the argument. Finally, there will be what I call its terminal
outcome, namely a doing of A.2 Other things being equal we do
what we intend to do. We may fail, but, unless we change our minds,
we try to do what we intend to do.
Let us now return to our original example of a logically valid or
deductive argument.
(a) P
if P, then Q
Therefore, Q
Clearly, if this argument presents our grounds for accepting Q, then
latter is not a first principle, because P, as its ground would be prior
or, so to speak, more first. Consider, now, the argument which we
found to be correlated with it:
(13) Q follows logically from P and if P, then Q.
P and if P, then Q are true.
Therefore it is reasonable to accept Q.
Argument (,) ends up with a conclusion which surely amounts to
the idea that there is a good and sufficient practical argument for
accepting Q. In a sense argument schema (13) is the schema of a
proof that there is a good and sufficient practicalrgument for accepting Q. What would that practical argument be?
Notice that (,3) itself is not a practical argument. It does not have
a conclusion of the form 'I shall do A.' We are looking for an argument of the form,
[premises]
Therefore, I shall accept Q.
Argument (,3) not only tells us that there is such an argument, ittells
us something about its nature. If we follow its clues, we arrive at
something like,
(y) Accepting the logical implications oftrue beliefs is conducive
to E.
Q is logically implied by P and if P, theri Q.
I shall bring about E.
I believe P and if P, then Q.

On Accepting First Principles / 305
P and if P, then Q are true.
Therefore, I shall accept Q.
What exactly the end-in-view, E, might be, is by no means easy to
spell out. Clearly it is some advantageous epistemic state involving
the making explicit of our beliefso that inconsistent beliefs can be
confronted with one another and questions pinpointed for subsequent
investigation.
However this may be, I shall say nothing more about argument
(y) on the present occasion. My aim has been to highlight the distinction between three closely related kinds of argument:
(1) the ground floor argument (a) which culminates in the
assertion of Q;
(2) the third level argument (13) which culminates in the
assertion that there is a good and sufficient argument for
accepting Q;
(3) the second floor argument (y) which has as its conclusion
"I shall accept Q."
The above distinction present aframework interms of which, I
believe, some light can be thrown on the problem of first principles.
And the first first principles which Ishall examine are the first principles of a scientific theory. Consider, for example, the hackneyed
example of the kinetic theory of gases developed as a deductive
system. One distinguishes between its postulates and the theorems
which are derived from them by logical means, thus:
[Postulates]
Therefore, [Theorems].
The theory isn't amere, or 'uninterpreted,' deductive system. Its point
is to be so correlated with empirical generalizations that it can be
said to explain them. These empirical generalizations are based on
observations and experiments, and constitute what many contemporary philosophers of science call 'confirmed law-like statements.'
They can, for our present purposes, be called empirical laws. In our
present example these laws pertain to temperature, volume, pressure,
etc. as empirical constructs, definable in terms of observable and
measurable quantities. The correlation of empiricalaws with
theorems in the deductive system is made by correlating the empirical concepts which occur in the empirical laws with theoretical

expressions defined in terms of the basic vocabulary of the theory.
This correlation of the vocabulary of the empirical laws with the
vocabulary of the theory was compared by Norman Campbell to a
dictionary. The dictionary is such as to correlate each confirmed empirical generalization or law with a theorem in the theory, and no
theorem in the theory with an empirical generalization which has
been falsified in the laboratory. The theory, if it is a good one, will
have 'surplus value' in at least the following sense. There will be indefinitely many theorems which the dictionary 'translates' into empiricalaw-like statements which have not yet been tested, indeed
may not yet have been thought of, or entertained. Thus the theory
suggests hypotheses some of which, given the current state of experimental technique, can be put to the test. If they survive, this is
a feather in the cap of the theory; if not something in the theory
must be modified.
But my purpose today is not to discuss in detail the correlation
of theoretical structures with experimental laws. The reader who is
interested inthis topic, will find an excellent account in Ernest Nagel's
The Structure of Science.3 My aim is rather to call attention to and
philosophize about a very simple and obvious point. It is not
necessary to support a theory by deriving its postulates or assumptions from other propositions, thus
[prior principles]
Therefore, [postulates of the theory].
If we refer to the postulates of the theory as its first principles, one
doesn't, typically, support atheory be deriving its principles from
something 'more first.' Yet even without such derivation it is often
reasonable to accept a theory. What makes it reasonable? What kind
of reasonableness is involved?
If we can solve the problem of the reasonableness of accepting
theories, we may get some light on the problem of the reasonableness
of first principles generally. For, it will be remembered, the problem
with which we began was exactly how it could be reasonable to accept first principles in view of the fact that this reasonableness cannot consist in their being derivable by logical means from prior
principles.
Now the generalines of the move I am going to make are obvious. We accept the first principles of a theory because we accept
the theory; and we accept the theory because of what it enables us

to do. This suggests that the rationale of accepting the theory is bound
up with practical reasoning. In other words we try to show that there
is a good and sufficient practical argument of which the conclusion
is 'I (or better, we) shall accept the theory.' We have thus established
contact with the considerations advanced in the opening section.
In other words, we need something like the following:
[premises]
Therefore, we shall accept the theory.
And our previous discussion suggests that it will be of the form:
We shall bring about E.
Bringing about E implies accepting theories of such and such
a character.
T is of this character.
Therefore, we shall accept T.
The logical outcome of this practical syllogism would be our intention to accept the theory. The terminal outcome would be the accepting of it.
Clearly the above is but the bare bones of an argument. I shall attempt shortly to put some flesh on these bones and, in particular,
to discuss (albeit briefly) the character a theory must have in order
to be worthy of acceptance. But before Ido this, let me call attention to the fact that intimately related to the above is another argument schema of decisive importance for our problem.
It will be remembered in the case of the deductive argument
p
If P, then Q
Therefore, Q
we distinguished between three interestingly related arguments. This
time we find only two, because ex hypothesi there is no relevant
argument which has the first principles of the theory as its conclusion.
As we saw, this is exactly the difference btween afirst principle
and derivative principles. In the case of derivative principles there
is a relevant deductive argument which ends up with the principle.
In the case of a first principle, there is no such argument, but there
is nevertheless a relevant practical argument and a higher order argument which concludes with the assertion that there is such a good
and sufficient practical argument. The latter is of the form:

[premises]
Therefore, there is a good and sufficient practical argument
of kind K for accepting T.
But what mighthe premises of this meta-argument be?
Before attempting toanswer this question let me call attention to
the fact that its conclusion seems to be equivalent to "It is probable
that-T" (where 'T' abbreviates the principles of the theory). It is
sometimes denied that the concept of probability has any application to theories. Many theories of probability take as their paradigm
a metrical probability which can be manipulated in accordance with
the mathematical calculus of probabilities, for example the probability
which is relevanto statistical contexts. This I regard as a radical
error, which has led to Procrustean theories of probability. I shall
argue that the concept of probability, though in a non-metrical and,
perhaps, comparative form, legitimately applies to theories and that
the way in which it applies illuminates the concept of probability
generally. The suggestion is that probability statements are
statements asserting the existence of a good and sufficient argument
for accepting the proposition which is said to be probable.
What would it be to show that there is a good and sufficient argument of a certain kind for accepting a certain proposition. Consider
the argument schema
(A1) We shall bring about E.
Bringing about E implies accepting Ts which are (P.
T1 is (.
Therefore, we shall accept T1.
What would the probability argument schema which corresponds
to this practical argument schema look like? Its conclusion, according to the above, will be: "Therefore there is a good and sufficient
argument of a certain kind for accepting T1" (i.e., according to our
analysis, "T1 is probable"). The higher order argument, itself, will
look something like this:
(MA1) A1 is a good and sufficient argument of kind K.
The conclusion of A1 is 'We shall accept T1'.
Therefore there is a good and sufficient argument of kind K
for accepting T1.
But what kind of argument iskind K? It is, in the first place, a pracThis content downloaded from 82.146.40.102 on Sat, 28 Jun 2014 18:09:23 PM

tical argument. Furthermore it is an argument of a kind which
postulates a certain end E and relates accepting theories of a certain
character (p to that end. But what kind of end-in-view might E be?
In the essay referred to above4 I characterize the property (p and
the end-in-view E in the case of the probability oftheories as follows:
(p is the character of being the simplest available framework
which generates new testable law-like statements, generates
acceptable approximations of empirically confirmed law-like
statements, and generates no falsified law-like statements.
What, then, is the end-in-view which we might have, so that we
would be favorably disposed to accept theories of such a character?
It will be remembered that in our discussion of the practical reasoning which has as its outcome the intention to accept the conclusion
of a deductive argument, we found the end-in-view tobe achieving
an epistemically advantageous state in which inconsistent beliefs can
be explicitly confronted with one another and brought within the
scope of systematic investigation. If we suppose that the end-in-view
of the latter investigation is the direct ability to produce adequate
conceptual pictures of relevant parts of our environment, then
epistemic states which contributeo this ability would come within
the scope of practical reasoning of the kinds we are considering. How
'good' (fine grained, coarse grained, etc.) a conceptual picture must
be to make possible the achieving of specific ends-in-view of a 'practical' character in a narrower sense of this term is a relative matter.
A map which is adequate for our purpose may be totally inadequate
for another.5
Thus, the epistemic end-in-view of unlimited accuracy and openended relevance is one which appeals to very few, and, of course, to
those to whom it has no appeal it cannot provide a major premise
for reasoning which culminates in "Therefore, I shall perform such
and such an epistemic act." Who, then, has this end-in-view, and what
does having it involve?
To one who does have this end-in-view,hatever may be involved in having it, the value of explicit consistency isclear. So, also,
is the value of working with theories which, in addition to generating
observationally acceptable approximations ofestablished empirical
generalizations, provide new empirical hypotheses which can be put
to the test as is the value of modifying orlaying aside theories which

generate disconfirmed law-like statements. But the upshot of this is
that while we have filled in some of the details of the family of
arguments pertaining to the accepting of theories by bringing in as
proximate end-in-view the having of confirmed empirical law-like
statements, thus
We shall have confirmed law-like statements.
Accepting theories which are q) is conducive to having
confirmed law-like statements.
T1 is (.
Therefore, we shall accept T1.
(with which is correlated a higher order argument which has as its
conclusion
Therefore, there is a good and sufficient argument of kind K
for accepting T1,
i.e., T1 is probable in the way in which theories are probable), there
is a gap between the abstract end-in-view we were discussing a moment ago, and the end-in-view of having confirmed law-like
statements.
To fill this gap I must develop one more line of thought pertaining
to the concept of probability. I argued above that those philosophers
who work with this concept and take as their paradigm those probabilities which fit neatly into the mathematical equations of the
calculus of probability tend to overlook the real conceptual core of
probability. It is characterized by some as a logical relation which
holds between an hypothesis and its evidence, but which, unlike implication, does not authorize the acceptance of the hypothesis on the
basis of the evidence. Thus the rationale of accepting probable
hypotheses ileft obscure-or it is even denied that there is such
a rationale. By others, probability statements are classified with
descriptive and factual statements about relative frequencies, idealized into statements about the limits of such relative frequencies. Again
the connection of such factual statements with the reasonableness
of accepting hypotheses concerning a short run to which these ideal
frequencies are relevant is left obscure, or even denied.
On the approach Ihave been defending, however, the connection
between probability and reasonable acceptance is analytic. Thus,
given that a proposition is probable, no additional step need be taken
to show that it is reasonable to accept it. To recommend this view,

however, Imust take into account more than the probability of
theories-for the very significance of this phrase is denied by many
of those with whom I am taking issue. I want, therefore, to show
how this approach can be extended to the probability of empirical
generalizations. It is my conviction that once we get a feeling for
what probability amounts to in the case of theories, then the classical
problem of induction with respecto empirical generalizations turns
out to be much more manageable, and many things fall into place
which would otherwise remain a tangled mess.
Let's suppose therefore that to say of a law-like statement, LL1,
that it is probable means something like this:
There is a good and sufficient argument of a certain kind for
accepting LL1.
This would itself be the conclusion of an argument of the type
represented by (,) in our earlier discussion. And the argument which
is asserted to exist will be a practical syllogism of the type represented
by (y).
The practical argument in question has the form:
We shall bring about E.
Bringing about E involves accepting law-like statements which
are tW.
LL1 is t.
Therefore, we shall accept LL1.
This schema raises the questions,
What is E?
and
What is the character, tp?
To take up the latter question first, it is clear that tJ has something
to do with the relation of LL1 to observation. This relation is a
logical relation, RL. Let us put it by saying that the law-like statement must 'accord' with the observational evidence. To determine
what 'according,' RL, might be, we must first come to some conclusion about the form of a law-like statement. And, curiously enough,
to do this we must come to some conclusion about the nature of the
end-in-view, E. Is it, perhaps, the state of possessing true beliefs about
the limit frequency of a quaesiturn property, Q, in an infinite

312 / Wilfrid Sellars
reference class, R? In other words, the relative frequency of cases
of Q among cases of R "in the long run?" Is it, limiting ourselves for
simplicity tonon-statistical law-like statements, the state of having
true beliefs of the form:
(x)(ffx gx),
i.e., (roughly) for all values of 'x', if x is f then x is g? Whichever
line we take we run into the difficulty that the end is one we could
never know ourselves to have reached, and I submithat any end
with reference to which the doing of a certain action is to be justified
must be the sort of thing that can be known to be realized.
The general point is related to our earlier attempt to distinguish
between a good practical argument and one which was merely valid,
i.e., to specify something which would play a role analogous to "having true premises" in the case of good non-practical arguments. There
we suggested that it was a matter of the actual existence of the intention to bring about E. But it now appears that the appraisal of
a practical argument as good requires that we say not only that the
agent had the intention and that he believed that the action would
realize it, but that it is actually realized. Thus, "Jones' action was
justified because it brought about E."
Instead of the phantom ends considered above I suggesthat the
end-in-view, E, in the case of the acceptance of law-like statements
is the state of being in a position to draw inferences concerning new
cases, in a way which explains the observed cases. In other words,
our proximate end-in-view is to have a principle of inference which
applies in the same way to 'new' and 'old' cases. And the state of
having such a principle is the sort of thing that we can know that
we are in. And to be in this state requires accepting principles of
inference which conform to this criterion. This accepting is what in
our terminology iscalled the terminal outcome of a practical
syllogism which has as its logical outcome or conclusion, "Ishall accept LL ".
Thus, reflection on the proximate end-in-view ofinductive reasoning supports the view, which, as we shall see, has independent support, that law-like statements have the form of principles of inference.
In the case of non-statistical law-like statements, we can suppose
that they have the form (roughly):
From 'x is f,' it may be inferred that 'x is g'.

The statistical case is more complex, and its exposition would involve the discussion of still another dimension of probability, that
which is represented by the schema
n/m Rs are Q.
This is an R.
Therefore, the probability that this is Q is n/m.
I have discussed this, as well as the above modes of probability, in
the essay referred to above6 and shall omit the topic here.
Now new evidence may well lead us to abandon one inference
ticket and accept another. But the point is that as long as we have
the evidence we do have, and this evidence is that all observed cases
of f are g, we know that we have an inference ticket which accords
with evidence and applies to the cases we expect to encounter.
As I see it, then reflection on the probability oflaw-like statements
reinforces a conception which arises independently in the exploration of problems pertaining to counter-factual conditionals, the intuitive distinction between accidental and non-accidental uniformities
and the concept of 'natural necessity.' For this exploration has constantly generated the idea (rejected only because it treads on radical
empiricist toes) that law-like statements are inference tickets. Unlike
the inference tickets of formal logic, they are empirically based in
the sense that they are accepted because it is reasonable to accept
them, given the evidence and given our proximate end-in-view.
Law-like statements, therefore, are empirically based principles of
inference which authorize such inferences a, to use a crude example, 'Lightning now, therefore thunder shortly.' Italso authorizes such
conditionals a'If there had been lightning then, there would have
been thunder shortly' and such statements as 'There was thunder
then because there had been lightning shortly before' and 'That there
was lightning shortly before made it necessary that there be thunder
then.'
It might well be said, "If the character of being a first principle,
as you conceive it, is one which can be possessed by "low-level empirical generalizations," it can scarcely be that which makes First
Principles First." I would begin my reply with an aside. The process
of theoretical explanation is in a sense the process of turning lowlevel first principles into derivative principles. I would then add that
there are many varieties (indeed dimensions) of first principles which
play into each others hands in the course of inquiring without losing

their firstness. But above all I would point out that our problem was
not "What is a first principle?" but "How can it be reasonable to accept a first principle?" and it may well be that the strategy outlined
above for dealing with the reasonableness of law-like statements and
theories may throw some light on the reasonableness ofholding those
more exalted First Principles with which philosophy must sooner or
later come to grips.

1950.
