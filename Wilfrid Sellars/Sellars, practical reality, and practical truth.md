Abstract
Wilfrid Sellars is usually read as claiming that only the
unobservable, theoretical objects which science would postulate at the ideal end of inquiry are real. Against this,
Willem deVries has suggested that we can develop a notion
of practical reality in the context of Sellars’s philosophy
which would pertain primarily to commonsense objects.
I use deVries’s suggestion as a foil to clarify Sellars’s own
commitments about the practical. I show that the notion of
practical reality is not necessary to secure the ultimate legitimacy of practical concepts. We can retreat to the less committed notion of practical truth. I argue that the notion of
practical truth may not be sufficient to ensure that ultimately legitimate practical concepts are commonsense concepts in Sellars’s framework. Nevertheless, deVries’s
suggestion highlights that Sellars’s vision of an ultimate conceptual system may have been richer than is often thought.
1 | INTRODUCTION
In his 2005 book on Wilfrid Sellars, Willem deVries claims that it is illuminating to add the concept of “practical reality” to Sellars’s philosophical toolbox.1 The concept of practical reality
applies to objects like artefacts and persons. Contrary to deVries’s suggestion, Sellars is usually
read as a philosopher with an austere ontological position according to which the only real entities are those which science would postulate at the ideal end of inquiry. DeVries’s suggestion is
thus original and momentous. If a notion of practical reality could be defended within Sellars’s
framework, this would, for example, support recent attempts to reconcile Sellars’s scientific naturalism with his emphasis on normativity (see, e.g., O’Shea 2009; Christias 2016).
My aim in this paper is to use deVries’s suggestion as a lens to bring into focus some of
Sellars’s own commitments about the practical. I want to show that the notion of practical reality

is not necessary to justify the ultimate legitimacy of practical concepts in Sellars’s system. The
notion of practical truth, which fits more smoothly into his system, is enough. However, the
notion of practical truth may not be sufficient to secure a further conclusion that deVries at least
prima facie embraces, namely that certain commonsense (or “manifest-image”) concepts are ultimately legitimate. Whereas Sellars seems to accept that there will be legitimate practical concepts
at the ideal end of inquiry, it is not obvious that these concepts are commonsense concepts. The
intent of the paper is to clarify both Sellars’s position and deVries’s extension of it. It does not,
however, defend Sellars’s ontological perspective (which is, I think, rightly controversial).2
I will proceed in the following steps. In section 2, I will introduce some of Sellars’s ideas which
are relevant to the subsequent discussion. In section 3, I will present deVries’s proposal. In section 4,
I will consider different reconstructions of the notion of practical reality. I will argue that even on a
plausible reconstruction the notion of practical reality is not necessary to secure the ultimate legitimacy of practical concepts in Sellars’s system. In section 5, I will therefore discuss the less committing notion of practical truth. I will argue that more argument is needed to show that practical truth
guarantees the ultimate legitimacy of commonsense concepts.
2 | PRELIMINARIES
It will be helpful to introduce some aspects of Sellars’s philosophical position relevant to this
paper, especially his approach to truth and reality. This is not an easy task in this confined
space. The two topics are connected with many other themes in Sellars’s thought, and there is
no consensus on how to interpret many of his claims in the first place. I will therefore limit
myself to Sellars’s basic ideas and to interpretations which I see as uncontroversial.3
Let us begin with a short overview of Sellars’s approach to truth. Sellars holds that, generically, to say that a statement4 is true is to say that it is semantically assertible (Sellars 1967,
chap. 5, §9). “Semantically assertible” means “correctly assertible according to the rules of our
language”. This notion of truth is applicable to any discourse in which we can assert things, be
it, for example, empirical, moral, modal, or mathematical discourse, although the criteria for
when a statement is assertible differ between discourses.
What is semantically assertible by us is relative to the conceptual system we endorse.
However, Sellars claims that we can also define a notion of ideal or ultimate truth.5 An ideally
true statement is a statement semantically assertible according to the rules of an ultimate conceptual scheme, which Sellars sometimes labels “CSP” (after C.S. Peirce). This ultimate conceptual
scheme is the ideal culmination of a process of conceptual change driven by scientific inquiry and
captures what is real in the strongest sense of the term (Sellars 1967, chap. V §75). These ultimately real entities will be the theoretical, microphysical entities postulated by science at the ideal
end of inquiry. By contrast, objects recognised by common sense like trees, tables, or houses, do
not really exist for Sellars, at least not in the way common sense conceives them.6
Ultimately, real objects will thus be unobservable, theoretical objects postulated by science.
However, not any unobservable entity is a candidate for being ultimately real in the first place.
Real objects must be concrete spatiotemporal objects. They do not include, for example,
2
Neither will I discuss the metaphysical challenges faced by non-reductionist accounts of commonsense objects, for example, lack of
parsimony or causal overdetermination (for discussion see Thomasson 2018 and Baker 2007). 3
For good overviews of Sellars on truth and reality, see DeVries 2005, chaps. 2 and 6; O’Shea 2007, chap. 6. 4
For ease of exposition, I will only speak about statements. However, for Sellars both statements and the corresponding thoughts and
beliefs are species of the same kind of conceptual entities. So, the examples used in the text are meant to be extendable to the mental
analogs of statements.

For a perceptive discussion of Sellars’s different varieties of truth, semantic assertibility, and related questions, see Shapiro 2020. 6
Sellars seems to put forward different views as to whether saying that a commonsense object does not really exist is identical to saying
that the object does not exist as conceived by common sense (but exists as conceived by scientific theory) or whether the former claim is
stronger than the latter (compare Sellars 1965b, n. 23; 1967, chap. V, §98–102; 1971, 407).

abstract entities like sets (see, e.g., Sellars 1979, chap. II), but only entities which can be “pictured” in Sellars’s specific sense. Picturing is a complex notion and there is no consensus about
its overall importance in Sellars’s system. Picturing is a non-semantic, causal mapping relation
between spatiotemporal objects in the world and linguistic objects themselves understood as
spatiotemporal objects, for example, instances of sound patterns or patterns of ink marks
(Sellars calls these “natural-linguistic objects”, e.g., Sellars 1979, chap. V §85). Sellars claims
that the criterion for semantic assertibility, that is, truth, in empirical discourse is pictorial correctness (Sellars 1967, chap. V §57).
At least at one point in his career, Sellars also claims that different conceptual systems picture the world with different degrees of adequacy. Whereas semantic assertibility “does not
admit of degrees” (Sellars 1967, chap. V §54), “pictures, like maps, can be more or less adequate” (Sellars 1967, chap. V §56). Based on this idea of differing degrees of pictorial adequacy,
Sellars introduces the notion of ideal pictorial adequacy, that is, of an ideal causal mapping of
objects in the world into natural-linguistic objects. According to Sellars, the ultimate Peircean
conceptual scheme would picture with ideal adequacy.7 For our discussion here, it is merely
important what the claim suggests about the nature of the objects which count as ultimately real
for Sellars. If we assume that Sellars’s ultimately real objects must be represented in an ideal
causal mapping process, these ultimate objects must be “mere” spatiotemporal objects, for only
such objects stand in causal relations and are pictured.
Such spatiotemporal, “picturable” objects can be characterised merely in descriptive terms
without reverting to normative expressions.8 In a similar vein, Sellars invokes an ideal of pure
description earlier in his career:
[N]aturalism presents us with the ideal of a pure description of the world (in particular of human behavior), a description which simply says what things are, and
never, in any respect, what they ought or ought not to be […] (Sellars 1957, 283;
Sellars’s emphases)
DeVries’s practical reality, in contrast, concerns normatively characterised objects. We must
therefore assess the claim that the concept of practical reality can supplement Sellars’s system
against the idea that what is ultimately real can be captured in purely descriptive terms.9
With regard to normativity, we will need a distinction concerning rules. Sellars thinks that
rules come in two types: ought-to-do rules and ought-to-be rules (e.g., Sellars 1967, chap. III,
§37–38; Sellars 1974, 423–24). Ought-to-do rules can be followed only by agents who have the
conceptual capacities to understand the rule. An example would be
1. I ought to pay taxes.
To conform to an ought-to-be, in contrast, no understanding of the rule is needed.
Ought-to-bes may be “implicit”, that is, merely realised in certain patterns of behaviour
7
However, the significance of this claim is a matter of dispute, see, for example, Rosenberg (2007) vs. Seiberth (2022). 8
I take this to be a generally accepted reading (see, e.g., Sicha 2014 for an interpretation of Sellars on these lines). See also Sellars 1979,
chap. I §33–34. For a potentially dissenting view see Koons and Sachs 2022. 9
A reviewer asks me to link the themes of this paper with Sellars’s claims about recategorization from his Carus lectures (Sellars 1981). In the
Carus lectures, Sellars is primarily concerned with the place of sensible qualities like colour in a naturalistic, scientific picture of the world.
Sellars claims that in this scientific picture sensible qualities will be recategorized as processes in the human brain. The notion of practical
reality does not concern the relation between sensory items and other physical entities, however. On Sellars’s position, both these latter will
turn out to be physical entities in a broad sense (so-called physical1 entities, Sellars 1981, lec. III). The notion of practical reality concerns a
different relation: the relation of the physical, even broadly conceived, to the normative or functional. For example, the question whether
pawns are practically real will not be affected by whether the physical object playing the role of a pawn will be ultimately characterised as itself
coloured, or whether what is commonsensically considered its colour will turn out to be a process in the nervous system.
SELLARS, PRACTICAL REALITY 573

(Sellars 1954). Even prelinguistic children or, importantly for us, artefacts can conform to
ought-to-bes. An example is
2. Clocks ought to chime at the full hour.
Obviously, a clock cannot understand (2), but its behaviour can still conform to the rule.
In normal cases, clocks behave in agreement with (2) because full-blown agents see to it that
they do. There is an inferential relation between the two types of rules for Sellars: ought-to-be
rules imply ought-to-do rules. So, (2) implies
3. One ought to make it the case that clocks chime at the full hour.
In what follows, I will frequently work with the notion of a practical concept. These are
concepts for things which deVries envisages as practically real, for example, artefacts, purely rulegoverned objects such as pawns, or persons. For inferentialists like Sellars, the content of a concept is determined by inference principles underwriting valid inferences in which the concept
occurs in an essential way (Sellars 1953). For practical concepts, these inference principles include
practical premises or conclusions, for example, ought-to-be rules:10
4. “This is a hammer” implies “This is to be used for pounding”.
This still leaves open the scope of the class of practical concepts. Seibt (2009) argues that we
can find a notion of low-grade normativity exhibited, for example, by biological entities in
Sellars. Similarly, Breunig (2022) claims that Sellarsian ought-to-be rules also apply to
biological entities. These interpretations appeal, among other things, to Sellars’s notion of
pattern-governed behaviour (Sellars 1954). Discussing bee dances, Sellars claims that the specific movements of a bee occur because of the pattern of the dance, and not merely in accordance with the pattern. They occur because they are, in a sense open to interpretation, the
“correct” movements (he spells out this “because” in terms of the evolutionary history of the
dance pattern, Sellars 1954, §14–16). Seibt’s and Breunig’s reading would allow that practically
real entities include biological entities like organs or enzymes. However, some of the concerns
raised in the next sections regarding deVries’s approach to artefacts only increase when we consider biological entities. Therefore, I will limit the discussion to artefacts.
Sellars’s ontological position is often formulated in terms of the relation between two competing conceptual frameworks: the manifest image and the scientific image of man in the world
(Sellars, 1962). The manifest image recognises only observable objects; its most basic objects
are persons. The scientific image conceptualises the world in terms of unobservable microphysical particles (or, ultimately, processes). In his exposition, deVries relies on this distinction.
To make contact with his discussion, but to avoid the possible metaphilosophical implications
of the term “manifest image” (see Sellars 1962, 44), I will use the term “common sense” in this
paper. I rely on the fact that Sellars often uses the term “common-sense framework” himself
as a contrast to “the theoretical framework” (Sellars 1967, chap. V, sec. IX–X; 1962, 59;
1963b, §94).11 To approximate how deVries (2005) handles the distinction between the commonsense framework and the scientific framework, I will often treat the distinction as sharp
without agreeing that this is the best way to understand it (e.g., the boundary between these
frameworks might be blurred by Sellars’s purely methodological distinction between
10See section 5 for more about how we should understand the prescriptive truths which deVries invokes.
11Sellars’s manifest image is not static but develops, among other things, by becoming scientifically more sophisticated through
induction and observational generalisation (but not through theoretical postulation). My use of the term “common sense” is not meant
to exclude these dynamic aspects.

(Sellars 1962, 41) ceases to be helpful at some point.
3 | DEVRIES ON PRACTICAL REALITY
In this section, I will introduce deVries’s notion of practical reality. DeVries (2005, chap. 10)
claims that Sellars’s philosophical commitments allow us to say that certain things12 are practically
real. Practical reality contrasts with the ultimate reality of the objects of an ideal completed science. On a standard understanding of Sellars’s scientific naturalism (see section 2), these purely
descriptive, theoretical scientific objects are the only ultimately real things. DeVries, however,
wants to supplement Sellars’s system with a practical mode of existence. His claims are intended
as a constructive extension of Sellars’s system, that is, he attempts to show that embracing the
notion of practical reality would be a natural step to take given other commitments Sellars makes.
To introduce the notion of practical reality, deVries exploits Sellars’s analysis of truth as
semantic assertibility. His strategy is based on the thought that “the real and the true are obviously deeply related” (deVries 2005, 271–72). What makes Sellars’s concept of semantic assertibility useful for deVries is that it can be applied to all kinds of statements, including normative
ones (also see Klemick 2020). According to deVries,
[a conceptual] framework or object is practically real iff there are categorical prescriptive truths with respect to that framework or object. (deVries 2005, 272; deVries’s emphasis)
I will not focus on conceptual frameworks but only on objects in general. As becomes clear
soon in deVries’s exposition, any conceptual framework must be practically real for its respective users as conceptual frameworks are constituted by inferential rules, that is, by a certain species of “prescriptive truths”. A framework’s practical reality boils down to linguistic or mental
performances being subject to such inferential rules. These performances are sufficiently covered by the generic term “object” for the practical reality of conceptual frameworks to count as
a special case of the practical reality of objects.13
DeVries’s definition leaves open whether he is concerned with the reality of singular objects
(as when one claims that Socrates is real) or with the reality of objects of a certain kind
(as when one claims that hammers are real). Sellars (1960, 508) distinguishes these two cases
but does not make clear whether one of them should have primacy in ontology. DeVries discusses the reality of such things as hammers and persons, so he seems to be primarily concerned
with the reality of objects of a certain kind. I will therefore adopt this perspective as well.14
Let us look at an example of a categorical prescriptive truth, that is, a true prescriptive
statement15 or a “practical truth” (for this term, see deVries, 2005, 272). At one point in
12I will use the terms “thing” and “object” in a broad sense including kinds of stuff or events. 13DeVries suggests a second definition, namely that “[a] framework is practically real iff there are within the framework intentions that
are warrantedly assertible, that is, intersubjectively reasonable and universally applicable” (deVries 2005, 272). This second definition
merely concerns conceptual frameworks, not objects in general. Given that my focus in the paper is wider, I will only discuss the first
definition.
14DeVries’s 2017 article on practical reality approaches practical reality through an analysis of Sellars’s treatment of “thing-kind terms”.
This also suggests that he is interested in the practical reality of objects of a kind. Thanks to an anonymous reviewer for pressing me to
clarify this issue.
15I will drop the term “categorical” from now on. In using the term, deVries probably wants to draw on Sellars’s discussion of
hypothetical and categorical reasonableness (e.g., Sellars 1967, chap. VII). The term “categorical” might thus be meant to guarantee
objectivity for prescriptive truths. But calling them “truths” seems to claim objectivity enough. Besides, I cannot see whether a true
normative statement like “Hammers ought to be suitable for pounding” (see section 5) is a categorical or a hypothetical truth and what
difference this would make for whether hammers are practically real.
SELLARS, PRACTICAL REALITY 575
 17552567, 2023, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/theo.12462, Wiley Online Library on [27/12/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License
his discussion, deVries turns to artefacts as a central species of practically real things. He
writes:
Hammers are to be used for pounding. There is an ought-to-be sitting in the
background that is at home in a set of institutional practices constituted by still
more ought-to-be’s and their related ought-to-do’s. (deVries 2005, 275; deVries’s
emphasis)
Thus, an example of the relevant kind of true prescriptive statements might be:
5. Hammers are to be used for pounding.16
Let us assume that (5) is correctly assertible, hence true. Because of the relation between “the
real and the true”, we can then conclude, according to deVries, that hammers are real, real in a
practical mode.
According to deVries, the truth of (5) is essential for something’s being a hammer (deVries
2005, 273). So, if for two things with the same material properties, it is true of one that it is to
be used for pounding but not of the other; the former is a hammer, whereas the latter is not.17
DeVries claims that this is so for commonsense objects only (deVries 2005, 273). In contrast,
practical properties are not essential for the objects of science being the objects that they are,
although expressions for scientific objects may occur in practical statements.18 So, deVries
apparently wants to limit full-blown practical reality to commonsense objects.
Sellars himself never mentions the notion of practical reality straightforwardly. DeVries
offers a footnote in Sellars’s essay “Scientific Realism or Irenic Instrumentalism” as textual
support. This footnote says:
This aspect of the situation [the need to enrich the scientific conceptual framework
with practical discourse], which is not stressed by Feyerabend, is illustrated by the
practical dimension of such common sense concepts as that of what it is to be a
hammer. (Sellars 1965b, n. 24)
The direct support for deVries’s suggestion in Sellars’s published essays is thus limited,19 especially if contrasted with Sellars’s frequent insistence that commonsense objects do not exist as
conceived by common sense (among them the very sentence to which the footnote above
belongs: Sellars 1965b, §48; and many others, e.g., Sellars 1962, 69; 1956, §41; 1963b, §86).
The notion of practical reality is meant to address a certain kind of unease that Sellars’s official ontological position can provoke. On this position, what is real are merely the unobservable
entities postulated by scientific theory. Sellars often qualifies this and claims that commonsense
objects do exist in the sense that commonsense concepts have successor concepts in the scientific
image (Sellars 1967, chap. V, §102; see also Sellars 1971, 407). Whether we understand Sellars
as claiming that commonsense objects are ultimately unreal or that they are real as reconceived
by science is thus largely a matter of emphasis. The bare question whether commonsense objects
are real for Sellars should therefore not be what most concerns deVries.20
16We will see later (section 5) that (5) is ambiguous.
17Not everyone might share this intuition.
18This may be controversial. Hacking (1983, 274) claims that what commits us to the existence of unobservable things is our ability and
readiness to manipulate them as tools in experiments. On such a position, practical truths about scientific postulates might be relevant
for their being the things that they are.
19But see the 1977 roundtable discussion explored in section 4.
20Thanks to an anonymous reviewer for suggesting this.

What seems to worry him more is that commonsense objects could exist merely as
reconceived by science for Sellars. The worry is that commonsense concepts are ultimately to be
replaced by scientific concepts21:
However wonderful the language of Peircean science is, however many more questions it permits us to ask and answer, it would be foolish to think that it would
replace wholesale the language of artifacts and useful objects. (deVries 2005, 275)
Here, deVries contrasts concepts for “artifacts and useful objects” with scientific concepts, that
is, he treats the former as commonsense concepts. And he seems to claim that at least some
commonsense objects are (practically) real on these commonsense terms, that is, as they are
conceived by common sense.22
One motivation behind this move appears to be that only by retaining commonsense
concepts can we, in deVries’s view, retain a normative aspect to the world, as the concepts of
the scientific image seem to be concepts of non-normative entities. On such a view, concepts for
normatively characterised, functional, or practical objects can be had, at least primarily, only as
commonsense concepts. To show that we can and must retain normative concepts at the ideal
end of scientific inquiry would therefore be to show that we can and must retain large areas of
our commonsense conceptual framework (or “the manifest image” in deVries’s usage).
In section 5, I will try to dissociate these two claims.
After discussing artefacts, deVries extends his account to persons as the most fundamental
practically real things (deVries 2005, 275). Nevertheless, I will not discuss persons. Such a discussion would be too protracted as it is connected with many other philosophical domains in Sellars,
for example, philosophy of mind or ethics. Rather, I will focus on artefacts, which deVries uses as
his prototypical examples of practically real things. For artefacts, that is, things humans produce
and use, the notion of practical reality has a strong, immediate appeal. Artefacts are thus a useful
test case. If deVries’s approach proves to be problematic in the case of artefacts, it may be possible
to extend this conclusion to other kinds of things.
4 | IS PRACTICAL REALITY A NECESSARY NOTION?
To evaluate the concept of practical reality and the sense in which it might be illuminating in the
context of Sellars’s thought, we must first try to understand the ontological status of practically
real things. I will start by looking at some possibilities and see how consistent they are with other
commitments Sellars makes. The aim is to reach a plausible understanding of the concept of practical reality. I will show, however, that on this understanding the notion of practical reality is not
necessary to secure the ultimate legitimacy of practical concepts in Sellars’s framework.
A first possibility would be to understand being practically real as an ontological status on a
par with Sellars’s ultimate empirical reality. In this case, deVries’s approach would obviously
risk a clash with Sellars’s official ontological position (see section 2). Also, deVries’s 2005
account of practical reality with its intimate connection between truth and reality prima facie
rests on a rather liberal understanding of what generates ontological commitment. He claims
that we can move from semantic assertibility to ontological claims. When we see these ontological claims as similarly robust as claims to ultimate reality, this liberal approach sits uncomfortably in Sellars’s framework. According to Sellars, all kinds of statements may be semantically
assertible. Besides empirical descriptive statements, this includes the normative statements
21Sellars does claim that the “framework of common sense is radically false” (Sellars 1965b, §48) or that the theoretical framework of
science can replace the commonsense framework “in all its roles” (Sellars 1967, chap. V, §90). 22See also his claim that “the world of the manifest image is practically real, whereas the world of the scientific image is not” (deVries
2005, 271; my emphasis).
SELLARS, PRACTICAL REALITY 577
 17552567, 2023, 5, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/theo.12462, Wiley Online Library on [27/12/2025]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License
which deVries builds on, but also mathematical, semantical, or modal statements (and, as
deVries himself argues later, 2017, 160, statements about fictional objects such as unicorns).
DeVries’s strategy could be applied in all these domains. The resulting rich ontological picture
might be acceptable as such,23 but it would not be recognisably Sellarsian anymore. Also,
deVries himself contrasts the status of practically real things, which he calls “perspectival
phenomena”, with the “aperspectival” ultimate reality of scientific entities (deVries 2005, 278).
DeVries later explicitly recognises that this understanding of practical reality cannot be
acceptable. In a more recent article on practical reality, he writes:
no ontological conclusions follow simply from the correct application of a semantic
term such as, for instance, “true” or “fact”. (deVries 2017, 161)
In the article, deVries supplants his former criterion for practical reality with a new one: causal
efficacy. However, he does not elaborate in what sense practically real entities are causally
effective. He argues that commonsense objects figure in good causal explanations. But he himself remarks that this would not yet show that “the kinds of thing-kinds that show up in our
practical deliberations can also show up in good causal explanations” (deVries 2017, 168). And
even if we could defend this latter point, it would probably be difficult to show that the respective practical thing-kinds occur in good causal explanations in virtue of their normative (rather
than merely their descriptive) aspects. Also, deVries’s rejection of Sellars’s explanatory monism
in the article moves him much further away from Sellars’s overall position than his 2005
approach. Whereas his 2005 account attempts a friendly extension of Sellars’s thought, his 2017
approach is a critical reassessment. For these reasons, I will not discuss his 2017 approach.
Our first possibility of how to understand the ontological status of practically real things
seems to be neither defensible in Sellars’s framework, nor the one intended by deVries. A second
possibility is to understand practical reality as a kind of minimal ontological status. Indeed, this
idea would seem to resonate with a certain aspect of Sellars’s thought. In several places, Sellars
claims that “there are” things of certain types (e.g., abstract entities or functional entities) in a
minimal sense, even though in a robust sense there are no such things:
[…] although there are attributes, there really are no attributes. It will be remembered that the qualification “really” indicates that a philosophical point is being
made, for in the ordinary sense of “really”, of course, there really are attributes.
(Sellars 1979, chap. 3, §1, Sellars’s emphases)
Might one not acknowledge that there are chess pieces, for example the pawn,
while denying that there really are chess pieces, for example the pawn?
(Sellars 1970b, 68; Sellars’s emphasis)
The second passage is highly salient, in particular, as a pawn is one of the things which we
ought to recognise as practically real on deVries’s approach.
Thus, for Sellars, “there are” certain objects in a weak, “ordinary” or “truistic”
24 sense.
Often, these seem to be objects which we can ordinarily talk about, whereas analysis shows that
this talk can be replaced by talk about other entities. Talk about abstract objects, as Sellars
claims, for example, can be replaced with talk about rule-governed linguistic tokens (see,
e.g., Sellars 1960), and this is why there really are no abstract entities. This, however, raises the
question what it means to say that there are abstract entities in a truistic sense. One possible
way to understand Sellars’s “truistic” sense of “things being there” is to use deVries’s strategy,
23The position would be similar to Amie Thomasson’s Easy Ontology (Thomasson 2018). 24For the expression “truistic” see Sellars 1979, chap. 1, §9.

that is, to connect it to semantic assertibility. Objects of kinds talked about in semantically
assertible statements would be those that “there are” in this weak sense.25 So, there might be
practically real objects in this weak or ordinary sense.
DeVries himself suggests in his later article that the idea of two parallel claims to reality, one
weaker and one more robust, would help to fit the notion of practical reality into Sellars’s system:
Part of the reason there is no conflict here is that the kind of realism in question
[realism based on semantic assertibility] is at best minimal. The physical or scientific realism that Sellars defends is surely more robust than this. (deVries 2017, 159)
However, he also emphasises that the notion of practical reality should provide us with something
more substantial than this weak ontological status. And this makes sense. Understood in a weak
way, practical reality would remain a kind of “second-class” reality in Sellars’s system. The motivation for introducing the notion was, however, to address some of the worries generated by Sellars’s
official ontological position concerning the status of commonsense objects and commonsense concepts. It is hard to see how a concept of practical reality modelled on Sellars’s minimal ontological
status could do so. Troubling questions could still be asked on this understanding of practical reality, such as: Given that, for example, artefacts are merely practically real, do they really exist
according to Sellars or must we embrace the uncomfortable position of ultimately rejecting their
existence (together with other things with a minimal ontological status)?
So, the two ontological statuses for practically real things straightforwardly available in
Sellars’s framework are either too strong to fit into his system or too weak to reduce the uneasiness springing from Sellars’s official ontological position. The obvious question is whether there
is room for a further possibility compatible with Sellars’s system. DeVries makes a move in this
direction by claiming that practical reality concerns “perspectival phenomena” or that it is reality “for us” (deVries 2005, 278; deVries 2017, 158). That does not take us very far, but some
resources provided by Sellars might help.
Ultimately, deVries is concerned with what concepts we can legitimately use at the ideal end
of scientific inquiry. He thinks that concepts for artefact kinds will belong to this group. The
status of artefacts as practically real is somehow meant to underwrite this legitimacy. Artefacts
gain this status by figuring in assertible practical statements. We need to specify, however, in
what conceptual scheme the relevant practical statements are assertible. Arguably, even though
deVries does not explicitly claim this, the relevant practical statements must remain assertible at
the ideal end of scientific inquiry, that is, they must be ultimate practical truths, in order for
practical reality to be more robust than Sellars’s minimal ontological status of “being there”.
For Sellars, too, the concepts which we can legitimately use at the ideal end of scientific
inquiry do not merely include descriptive concepts for scientific postulates but also at least a
certain type of practical concept. The most well-known claim to this effect can be found in “Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man”. Here, Sellars claims that we can and must supplement science’s descriptive resources with “the language of community and individual
intentions”. We can do so without conflict as expressing intentions is different from describing
or explaining, the primary goals of science (Sellars 1962, 77).
However, in “Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man” Sellars seems to limit the supplementation of the scientific image to the conceptual resources that allow us to form intentions,
that is, the intention-forming expression “shall”.
26 DeVries thinks this is too little and wants to
25With the exception of fictional entities. For Sellars, statements about them are bracketed by a “once upon a time” rubric (Sellars 1979,
chap. V, §60). 26Sellars’s intention expressions, i.e., the linguistic expressions which constitute “the language of community and individual intentions”,
have the form “I shall/We shall do A in circumstances C.”. Intention expressions do not belong to descriptive discourse for Sellars.
Sellars analyzes normative statements, such as his ought-to-be and ought-to-do rules, in terms of intention expressions (although the
details of this analysis are contested, see Dach 2021).
SELLARS, PRACTICAL REALITY 579

preserve this legitimacy for a far wider range of practical concepts. His implicit argumentative
strategy itself, however, seems to be similar to Sellars’s own. The following tries to be an informal, plausible reconstruction of the relevant line of reasoning. The argument is based on two
premises which can be attributed to Sellars, and a third premise added by deVries:
1. Science endeavors to “describe and explain” things (Sellars 1956, §41), and thereby refines
our descriptive concepts.
2. Normative statements cannot be reduced to descriptive statements (Sellars 1957, 282–83).
[C1] Therefore, normative statements will remain assertible at the ideal end of scientific
inquiry. There are no descriptive scientific successor statements to replace them.
3. The content of a widespread type of concepts, i.e., practical concepts, is constituted in part
by inferential principles with normative premises or conclusions, i.e., inferential principles
conveyed by normative statements (deVries 2005, 274–75).
[C2] Therefore, practical concepts cannot be reduced to descriptive concepts. There will
still be inference principles constituting practical concepts at the ideal end of scientific inquiry.
[C3] Therefore, the things picked out by the respective practical concepts are
practically real.
[C4] Therefore, these concepts are ultimately irreducible and contentful, thus ultimately
legitimate.27
On this understanding of practical reality, the status of practically real objects is not on a par
with Sellars’s ultimately real objects. Ontological commitment to these latter is generated by
very different considerations (about, e.g., explanatory coherence); they are “aperspectival”
objects as deVries says. At the same time, “being practically real” is more robust than Sellars’s
mere truistic “being there”. It pertains to objects belonging to kinds which still appear in semantically assertible statements at the ideal end of scientific inquiry; talk about these kinds is not
reducible to or replaceable by talk about other things.
Nevertheless, the argument reconstructed above raises the question whether the notion of
practical reality itself is necessary to reach the overall conclusion. [C3] seems superfluous in
our reconstruction. With [C2] we already have the idea of ultimately semantically assertible
practical statements and can therefore conclude that there are ultimately contentful practical
concepts. If deVries’s intent is to defend the ultimate legitimacy of practical concepts, it seems
that the notion of practical reality has no substantial role to play in his argument.
Let us have a closer look at what Sellars himself says. The idea that practical concepts
would still be legitimate at the ideal end of scientific inquiry resonates with something which
Sellars claims at a later point in his career (besides the merely suggestive footnote in
Sellars 1965b28). During a roundtable discussion at Ohio State University in 1977,
Sellars suggests that practical concepts might survive into the scientific image.29 He introduces
27What Sellars might have seen only after 1962, is that there is a normative element in many of our concepts which can be retained at the
ideal end of scientific inquiry (so before, he might not have recognised the full force of the third premise). But compare (Sellars 1963b,
§95) on the concept of a person, (Sellars 1957, 283) on the concept of a criminal, and (Sellars 1963a) on “mixed concepts” like that of a
prime minister.
28It seems plausible that Sellars’s following remarks from 1977 elaborate what he meant in his 1965 footnote. 29A transcription of the discussion has been published as an appendix to Sellars’s Notre Dame Lectures (Sellars 2015). Hicks (2020,
n. 35) also connects deVries’s notion of practical reality and the 1977 roundtable discussion. But as will become clear in what follows,
the connection ought not to be drawn too tightly.

a distinction concerning artefacts which, in his published essays, he draws only for conceptual
entities like sentences or thoughts. This is the distinction between what he calls “function” and
“content”
30:
[…] being a table is a functional notion: a table is something one puts dishes on and
so on. The real, you might say, “concept” of table already allowed for radically
different kinds of things fulfilling the function of table.
[…] We would have, roughly, the distinction between the function and what is
performing the function. In the Manifest Image, what is performing the function is,
roughly, a colored solid with certain properties, e.g., causal properties; then, in the
scientific image, what is performing that function is a systems [sic] of
microparticles.
[…] Well, I don’t see, once we draw a distinction between functional concepts and
content concepts, why the Scientific Image couldn’t contain functional words. […]
Why couldn’t it contain the word ‘“table”?
31 (Sellars 2015, 359–360; Sellars’s
emphasis)
So according to Sellars, concepts like the concept of a table are function concepts. The table
function can be fulfilled by varying “contents”, that is, things with varying physical make-ups.
It is the commonsense descriptions of these physical properties of things, so content concepts,
that are replaced in the move from the commonsense framework to the scientific framework.
Functional concepts, in contrast, would be unaffected by this move. We might then understand
deVries’s strategy in defending a notion of practical reality as exploiting the functional aspect of
the things mentioned by Sellars, an aspect which would be captured by true practical
statements.
However, it is not clear whether these claims on Sellars’s part come with any robust ontological commitment to practical objects. During the roundtable discussion, Sellars himself
merely claims that we can add “words” (i.e., concepts), like “table”, to the scientific image. So,
Sellars arguably does consider such concepts legitimate at the ideal end of scientific inquiry. He
does not say, however, whether this implies that tables, conceived as functional items, are real in
some sense or other. Above, we saw that Sellars claims in 1970 that functional items like pawns
“are there” only in his minimal sense. So, it is not clear that Sellars would see a need for an
ontological notion like practical reality to guarantee the ultimate legitimacy of practical concepts. And at any rate, tables as conceived by common sense in their physical aspects remain
unreal for Sellars.
Additionally, Sellars apparently wants to dissociate the truth of practical statements, in
particular, from existence claims. In “Hochberg on Mapping, Meaning, and Metaphysics”
(from the same year as the roundtable discussion), he remarks that “practical contexts” do not
require that there are instances of the kinds of things talked about. That the statement.
6. Trespassers will be [in the sense of “shall be” or “ought to be”] punished.
30Given that the expression “content” is often associated with conceptual or intentional content in philosophical discussions, Sellars’s
terminology is not fortunate. “Conceptual content” belongs on the function-side of Sellars’s content-function distinction. What he means
by “content” in the roundtable discussion is usually called “form” or “physical structure” in discussions about artefacts. 31This raises the question if we can neatly distinguish content concepts and function concepts. At least for artefacts, there are close
relations between content and function (content constrains function and vice versa). Sellars’s own use of the word “table” underwrites
these concerns. In (Sellars 1962), he uses the example of a table to show that the scientific image does not contain commonsense tables.
His use of the word “table” there picks out objects with the normal physical properties of tables and so expresses a content concept. This
contrasts with his claim from the roundtable discussion that “table” expresses a function concept.

is semantically assertible (and the underlying inference principle accepted) does not imply or
presuppose that there are (or were, or ever will be) trespassers (Sellars 1977, n. 9). But this does
not compromise the legitimacy of the practical concept of a trespasser.
The legitimacy of practical concepts may be therefore unconnected to robust ontological
claims for Sellars. Applying this perspective to artefacts, the statement
5. Hammers are to be used for pounding.
might still be assertible at the ideal end of inquiry and the underlying inference principle still
recognised even if there were no hammers as either common sense or science conceive them
(maybe because people would not need to do any pounding anymore, or just by coincidence).
Part of the problem here is that statements like (5) have the wrong logical form to generate
ontological commitment. Ontological commitment is expressed, for Sellars, in statements of the
form “There are Ks.” (Sellars 1979, chap. 1, §7), not in generic statements such as (5), and the
latter do not imply the former. But this is probably not the whole problem in Sellars’s eyes, as
his remarks from (Sellars 1977) are geared specifically to practical contexts. What is specific
about practical contexts for Sellars is that even in cases where there are, for example, no hammers, statements like (5) will not be simply vacuously true (see Sellars’s correspondence with
Michael Loux published as an appendix to Sellars 1979).32 As a consequence, we can individuate practical kinds even if there are no members of these kinds. One reason why this makes
sense is that practical contexts are often connected to planning for contingent situations
(as in the trespasser case), and thus can employ legitimate concepts in semantically assertible
statements, whereas the things talked about do not yet, or might never, exist.
To summarise, Sellars would probably have wanted to distinguish questions about the legitimate use of concepts from questions of “what there is” or “what is real”. At the same time, his
remarks from the 1977 roundtable discussion suggest that he acknowledges the ultimate legitimacy of practical concepts. Sellars’s notion of function concepts from that discussion might be
spelled out by means of deVries’s assertible practical statements (and the inference principles
underlying these). However, Sellars also dissociates the assertibility of practical statements from
ontological implications without wanting to compromise our ability to distinguish different
practical kinds. This suggests that deVries’s approach actually throws light on a claim Sellars’s
himself seems, in the end, disposed to accept, that is, that there are ultimately legitimate practical concepts, but that Sellars would not regard the concept of practical reality itself as necessary
to guarantee this legitimacy.
5 | PRACTICAL TRUTH AND COMMONSENSE PRIVILEGE
In the last section, I argued that deVries’s notion of practical reality is not necessary to defend
the ultimate legitimacy of practical concepts in Sellars’s framework. This is good news, as
semantically assertible practical statements seem insufficient to secure a robust ontological status for practical objects for Sellars in the first place. However, the notion of practical truth as
such, that is, of ultimately assertible practical statements, has emerged as a starting point potentially shared by Sellars and deVries. In this section, I will therefore shift the focus to practical
truth and bypass the notion of practical reality. I now want to discuss another conclusion which
deVries at least prima facie aims to secure. This is the claim that by showing that some practical
concepts must be legitimate at the ideal end of scientific inquiry we also show that many commonsense concepts must be ultimately legitimate. I will maintain that more argument is needed
to support this claim.
32Thanks to a reviewer for pointing this out.

DeVries does not openly claim that the practical concepts which would still be legitimate
at the ideal end of scientific inquiry would be commonsense concepts. However, he seems
interested in preserving the legitimacy of certain commonsense concepts through such a
move. This is, for example, apparent from the following passage, where he ascribes the idea
to Sellars that
unification [of the commonsense and the scientific conceptual frameworks] will
accord science ontological primacy but will have to preserve the practical (that is,
normative) concepts found in the manifest image. (deVries 2005, 22)
There seems to be no clear distinction as such in his exposition between the question
whether practical concepts will remain ultimately legitimate and the question whether some
commonsense concepts will remain so.33 In contrast, I would like to put pressure on the idea
that a positive answer to the first question necessitates a positive answer to the second question
in Sellars’s framework.
DeVries seems to treat the distinction between the commonsense conceptual framework
(or “the manifest image”) and the scientific conceptual framework as clear-cut (see, e.g., the
discussion opening chapter 10 of deVries 2005).34 On this position, concepts can be either
commonsense concepts or scientific concepts, that is, these are mutually exclusive. Such a
view is in part supported by Sellars’s own rhetoric, for example, about the manifest and the
scientific image being two complete, competing conceptual systems which each purport to
be “the whole truth” (Sellars 1962, 57). In this section, I want to show, however, that Sellars
may also give us reasons to see this position as too simple, at least concerning practical
concepts.
DeVries’s strategy entails the need for some kind of privilege for common sense when it
comes to practical truth. If there is no such privilege, the notion of practical truth will not be
effective in defending the ultimate legitimacy of commonsense concepts. If science were able to
refine our practical concepts (just as much as it is able to refine and replace our descriptive commonsense concepts), the ultimately legitimate practical concepts might not be reasonably seen
as commonsense concepts. DeVries himself emphasises this “asymmetry” in favour of common
sense:
From the point of view of practical reality, there is an asymmetry between the manifest and the scientific images […] The manifest image has a claim to greater practical reality than the scientific image […] (deVries 2005, 272)
[T]he manifest image retains priority, practical priority, over the scientific. (deVries
2005, 273; deVries’s emphasis)
Any normative or prescriptive dimension [in scientific objects] is a mind-dependent
addition, so the objects of the scientific image are practically ideal. (deVries 2005, 273)35
33Even should deVries not be prepared to make the claim that many of our commonsense concepts will remain legitimate at the ideal
end of inquiry because many practical concepts will remain so, the claim as such is still worthwhile discussing (among other things
because the idea that normative concepts are somehow bound to the commonsense framework is suggested by other Sellars scholars, see,
e.g., Sicha 2014, §34). This claim would entail that the respective contributions of Sellars’s manifest and scientific image to an ultimate
conceptual scheme should be seen as more balanced than often thought.
34However, more recently deVries presents the relation between the manifest image and the scientific image as more dynamic
(e.g., DeVries 2016). 35This may be misleading. It suggests that commonsense objects are practically real in a mind-independent fashion. But deVries would
probably agree that if there were no minds, nothing whatsoever could be practically real.

DeVries offers a brief argument for this privilege of common sense. He claims that much as
common sense, or Sellars’s manifest image, cannot answer all the empirical questions it raises,
the scientific image cannot answer all the practical questions it raises. His examples of practical
questions which science cannot answer include “when scientific investigation is worthwhile or
how the knowledge science generates is best used” (deVries 2005, 273). However, it does not
become clear why, according to deVries, science should be in principle unable to answer such
questions (and as I will try to show below, Sellars’s position might differ from deVries’s position
in this respect).
Can we identify a privilege for common sense concerning practical truth with Sellars’s
resources? I will discuss three options compatible with what deVries says, in an order of descending weight of the respective asymmetry. I would like to raise doubts at least about the two
more substantial ones, for general reasons and for specific reasons deriving from Sellars’s work.
The first and strongest proposal about such a possible commonsense privilege concerns the
question, also raised by deVries, “Who answers practical questions?” Common sense, the suggestion goes, is more competent than science in determining which practical statements are
assertible. Intuitively, what it means to say that common sense or science answer practical questions is that we need commonsense or scientific procedures to do so, or alternatively that commonsense or scientific concepts need to be used to formulate the answers to these questions.
Most importantly here, for Sellars, commonsense procedures exclude the postulation of
unobservable entities and the commonsense framework excludes concepts for such entities.
Let us first try to make deVries’s proposal more precise. DeVries suggests statements like
(5) as examples of practical statements:
5. Hammers are to be used for pounding.
However, (5) can be read in at least two ways in the context of his discussion. He claims that
“there is an ought-to-be sitting in the background” here (deVries 2005, 275), that is, a rule which
establishes some standard or norm concerning hammers. Probably, this ought-to-be is not
7. Hammers ought to be used for pounding.
(7) is a rule prescribing how people ought to use hammers. However, it is not reasonable to
assume that there is such a rule. Sellars’s ought-to-be rules are normative in a thick sense. They
do not express a norm in the sense of merely normal or expected behaviour but a norm the deviance from which is sanctioned, in the sense that deviance from the norm can be legitimately
criticised (Sellars also calls these norms “rules of criticism”, Sellars 1967, chap. III, §37; see also
Sellars 1973a, §30–32). But if I use my hammer as a paper weight instead of pounding with it,
I will not be criticised for violating a rule.36 So, (7) does not even seem to be semantically
assertible.37
The ought-to-bes which deVries thinks of might rather be of this type:
8. Hammers ought to be of unyielding materials.
9. Hammers ought to have a handle fit for human hands.
or, generally,
36Of course, in some cases, there are rules for the use of an artefact, which I will break if I use the artefact in any other way. Sacred
objects are an example. But this is not generally the case.
37A reviewer remarks that we might want to read (7) conversely as “If one needs to pound something, one ought to use a hammer”
(instead of “If something is a hammer, it ought to be used for pounding”). Such a reading is certainly not excluded, but that does not
affect my point. Even read in this alternative way (7) does not seem to be semantically assertible. I do not violate a rule if I use a
different tool for pounding.

10. Hammers ought to be suitable for pounding.
However, deVries also suggests that he may have something else in mind. He says that.
artifacts carry along with them implicit reference to functions, to social institutions
and practices, and thereby to systems of norms. […] we can both distinguish the
role-player and the role played, the function embodied and the embodiment of the
function […] (deVries 2005, 275)
DeVries’s reference to functions suggests that he might understand (5) as a specification of the
function of an artefact, or:
11. Hammers are for pounding.38
This would have the advantage of chiming in nicely with Sellars’s terminology from the
1977 roundtable discussion introduced in section 4.
Statements (10) and (11) are closely linked; some might even argue that they have the same
truth-conditions. (11), at least, implies (10); that is, function constrains what features an object
which successfully fulfils the function ought to have. Also, the truth of both (10) and (11) has
normative consequences for the things talked about. How close the relation between (10) and
(11) might turn out to be will not matter much for my strategy, however. This will be to argue
that neither for statements like (10) nor (11) is it obvious that common sense is privileged over
science in establishing their assertibility.
Let us first look at statements about functions. The notion of function has been elaborated
most thoroughly in philosophy of biology. However, attempts have been made to extend the
ideas developed in the biological context to the analysis of artefacts (for discussion see,
e.g., Preston 2013). The most salient examples are probably Millikan’s proper functions
(Millikan 1984) and Cummin’s notion of functions (Cummins 1975). A proper function is the
effect which accounts for the reproduction of the ancestors of a certain thing. Cummin’s functions are what a thing contributes to the successful functioning of the system of which it is a
part. None of these accounts implies that common sense should have any superiority over science in determining function.
At first sight, of course, common sense can correctly identify the functions of many things,
for example, hammers or tables. But there are less prototypical instances of artefacts, such as
items of sophisticated scientific equipment or culturally specific artefacts of foreign cultures
(including prehistorical artefacts). We probably do not want to deny that there are truths about
their function. In these cases, however, we may need physical theory or anthropological and
archaeological inquiry,39 so scientific theorising and the postulation of unobservables, to determine whether a function-specifying statement concerning them is assertible. Additionally, even
for some very mundane artefacts, for example, electrical cables, we may not be able to formulate an adequate and precise specification of their function without using at least some concepts
for unobservables. Thus, there seems to be no obvious asymmetry in favour of common sense
in determining the assertibility of function-specifying statements in general.
As for ought-to-bes about artefacts, establishing their assertibility likewise often seems to be
a matter of scientific inquiry. The preceding considerations about function statements carry
over to the respective ought-to-bes. But there is even more to be said in their case. Even for such
38Obviously, it is controversial how to understand (11) itself. That something is for pounding might mean that its designer intended it to
fulfil this function, or that users normally use it for pounding, or that its Millikanian “proper function” is to pound, etc. (for discussion
see Preston 2013). 39These are not pure “manifest-image” sciences: They standardly employ methods based on theories about imperceptible particles, for
example, radiocarbon dating.

prototypical, Heideggerian artefacts as hammers it may be a scientific question how they ought
to be made up to fulfil their function in the best possible way (concerning, for example, the
microphysical properties of the materials used40). As we move towards less prototypical artefacts (GPS devices, scientific equipment, but also things like fertiliser or ballpoint pen ink), the
idea that common sense can formulate ultimate norms about how such things ought to be made
up seems increasingly unreasonable.
There is support by Sellars himself for the idea that the ultimate decision of whether an
ought-to-be is assertible does not necessarily belong to common sense. In the last chapter of Science and Metaphysics (Sellars 1967, chap. VII), Sellars discusses “ought” and, in this context,
introduces the story of Smith and the Academy. Sellars imagines Smith, who has a certain
intention: lifting a heavy object. Smith is accompanied by “the Academy”, several highly expert
scientists. Sellars suggests that the best way for Smith to find out what he ought to do to lift the
heavy object is to pass this question on to the Academy, who come up with an answer:
The necessary and sufficient condition of Smith’s raising the heavy object is his
using the rod as a lever and the stone as a fulcrum.
The scientists deduce from this the ought-to-be that
[T]herefore, Smith ought to use R [a rod], etc. (Sellars 1967, chap. VII, §40)
Of course, Sellars’s example is a template and stands in for more complex situations.
The principle which enables the scientists to deduce this ought-to-be is
“p” implies “q” $ “Shall be [p]” implies “Shall be [q]” (cf. Sellars 1967, chap.
VII, §13)
together with some account of the relation between ought-statements and intention expressions
like “Shall be [p]”. Sellars is usually understood as saying that ought-statements themselves are
specific intention expressions (for details, see, e.g., deVries 2005, chap. 9). The “shall be”s in the
principle above could thus be directly replaced by ought-statements. The idea in the background of the principle is that the implication relations between intentions, and therefore which
intentions are reasonable and thus which ought-statements to accept, are determined by the
implication relations between descriptive statements. These latter implication relations are
established by scientific inquiry.41 So, arguably according to Sellars, many ought-to-bes are
established as true by means of inference principles established by scientific inquiry. It seems
therefore justified to say that for Sellars scientific inquiry ultimately decides on the semantic
assertibility of a substantial share of ought-to-bes.42 At least, the claim that common sense
determines the assertibility of ought-to-bes in general is not self-evident in Sellars’s framework.
There are potential objections to the line of reasoning presented so far. This brings us to a
second possibility of what could be meant by deVries’s “asymmetry”. It can be objected that
first it is enough that common sense establishes the assertibility of practical statements about
some artefacts, such as tables or hammers, but not all of them (so, e.g., not for scientific equipment). DeVries could perhaps absorb the idea that science answers practical questions about
40So, in Sellars’s terms, by scientifically reconceiving hammers in their physical aspects. 41For an accessible presentation of these thoughts, see Sellars’s unpublished “ʻOughtʼ and Moral Principles” (Sellars 1966). 42Sellars’s “Academy” appears to include “manifest-image” scientists, for example, historians and “even students of the gods”
(Sellars 1967, chap. VII, §39). But Sellars himself classifies at least part of this seemingly problematic group, that is, behavioural and
social scientists, as “scientific-image” scientists (Sellars 1962, 56). Also, as soon as we are in the scientific project of describing and
explaining things, of formulating “nomologicals” and establishing inference principles, we cannot ignore Sellars’s (admittedly
controversial) commitment to explanatory monism, where ultimate explanations are provided at the ground level of postulational
science.

some kinds on its own, as long as there are practical kinds where common sense is privileged.
Second, even while science might determine whether some specific ought-to-bes are assertible
about, for example, hammers, the respective overarching, most general practical statements
(e.g., that hammers ought to be suitable for pounding) might still be established by common
sense.43 Whereas this second proposal about commonsense privilege in practical matters is
already very restricted compared to the first suggestion, it arguably saves a sense in which a substantial share of the practical concepts at the ideal end of inquiry could still count as commonsense concepts.
But we can raise doubts about this proposal as well. First, it is not obvious that the
resulting concepts could straightforwardly be declared commonsense concepts. For an
inferentialist like Sellars, the meaning of an expression, and thus the content of the respective concept, is the inferential role of this expression (Sellars 1953). When science specifies,
for example, what material hammers ought to consist of in order to be most suitable for
pounding, science extends the inferential role of our hammer concept (or its “inferential
potential”, see Peregrin 2014, chap. 3.3). Speakers also might be said to have a better or
worse grasp of a concept, depending on the extent of the respective inferential potential
which they have mastered:
[H]aving the concept “φ” is a matter of degree, ranging from having a rudimentary
knowhow to having a very subtle knowhow with respect to “φ”. (Sellars 1973b, 491)44
On this view, a full grasp of the ultimate concept of a hammer (if there is one) would include an
understanding of inferential rules established by science.45 The respective hammer-concept
would consist of a mixture of inferential rules established by common sense and those
established by science. The challenge is to say why we should regard the result as a commonsense concept of a hammer.
A proponent of deVries’s view might argue as follows: Sellars claims that we can see conceptual change as rational and continuous. Changes like the one from the Newtonian simultaneity
concept to the relativistic simultaneity concept are not discontinuous but can be seen as developments within one generic simultaneity concept. We can specify a shared subset of inferential
rules for “Newtonian simultaneity” and “relativistic simultaneity”, thus delineating a generic
concept of simultaneity (Sellars 1967, chap. V, §39–45). Similarly, we might say that our current
hammer concept, say “hammer”2023, and the ultimate concept, “hammer”CSP, are both hammer
concepts because they share some subset of inferential rules. This subset, so the argument goes,
must always include the rule underlying statements (10) or (11). If we grant that this rule is
established by common sense, we must acknowledge that a generic commonsense hammer concept survives at the ideal end of scientific inquiry.
However, there are reasons to think that this does not yet amount to a substantial privilege
for common sense. We need to distinguish different senses in which a practical concept may survive into the scientific image and stay legitimate. The sense of legitimacy with which we have
been working so far was based on there being valid inferential rules concerning an expression or
a concept at the end of inquiry, such as the rules underlying (10) and (11). However, legitimate
practical concepts may be more or less “practically adequate” (and this might be a further useful
notion to add to Sellars’s system). For illustration, the practical concept of a hand axe is still
perfectly meaningful and legitimate in our broad sense. There are inferential rules underlying
practical statements about what hand axes are for and what they ought to be suitable for.
43Thanks to an anonymous reviewer for formulating this objection.
44See also Drobnˇak 2021. The context of Sellars’s remark is a discussion about whether we need to understand ought-to-be rules before
we count as having a certain concept. But the remark itself seems to be intended in a more general vein.
45As I suggest in the following paragraphs, such a scientifically enriched practical concept could be seen as “practically more adequate”
than the unenriched hammer concept.
SELLARS, PRACTICAL REALITY 587

However, hand axes are less useful for us to achieve the purpose they are supposed to achieve
than artefacts used today (whether this purpose is hunting, cutting or a symbolic purpose). In
this sense, certain concepts for artefacts used today are practically more adequate than the hand
axe concept.
This raises the question whether we could speak of ultimately practically adequate concepts
in Sellars’s framework, that is, concepts of practical items which fulfil our needs in the ultimately best way. Relatedly, we can ask how we find out what is ultimately practically adequate.
And Sellars suggests an answer. His parable about Smith and the Academy introduced above
concerns, among other things, the scope of what science can tell us in practical matters. The full
extent of Sellars’s claims surfaces only when he continues his narrative after the point where we
left. Sellars writes about his team of scientists:
After studying [Smith] they consult among themselves and agree
If Smith wants to lead a satisfying life, he ought to lead a life of kind
L. (Sellars 1967, chap. VII, §66)
After some years of studying with the Academy, Smith comes to agree. This narrative indicates
that for Sellars science determines which intermediary goals and interests can be derived from
our overarching goals (again, by formulating the relevant inference principles). This does not
only concern what is implied by our overarching personal goal of leading a satisfying life but
even what is implied by the overarching goal, which according to Sellars defines “the moral
point of view”: the goal that each of us foster our common welfare.46 Sellars suggests this in this
short reminiscence of Smith:
Yet we feel that the moral ought is, in principle, unequivocal, i.e. that if, like Smith,
we had ideal knowledge, what we ought to do would be uniquely determined.
(Sellars 1967, chap. VII, §78; Sellars’s emphasis)47
The point is that although science might not directly establish the assertibility of statements like
(10) Hammers ought to be suitable for pounding.
it does establish whether we need the ability to pound to ensure our common welfare or personal happiness and whether hammers would be the ultimately most suitable devices to fulfil
the purpose (and if so, why this is the case). On this view, science would establish which practical concepts are ultimately practically adequate. This opens the domain of what is practically
adequate to wholesale scientific revision. Thus, whereas statements like (10) might remain
assertible even at the ideal end of scientific inquiry, the legitimacy of the concept of a hammer
based on this might possibly be only thin (as is the legitimacy of the hand axe concept today).
It could be a legitimacy without practical adequacy.
DeVries writes as if the idea that there will probably always be human everyday life with
everyday life concerns like fixing things, or winning the heart of a loved one, supported the
thought that practical concepts must remain commonsense concepts (deVries 2005, 280).48
But in light of Sellars’s claims from above, this needs stronger support. The commonsense
“privilege” which remains if we take these claims seriously concerns only a restricted class of
46For details on these two practical perspectives see, for example, (Sellars 1970a). 47For more straightforward suggestions that scientific inquiry determines what we ought to do, including the moral domain, see
(Sellars 1966) and a draft of chapter VII of Science and Metaphysics (Sellars 1965a, §98—assumed date). 48This does not mean that we must abandon concepts like the concept of love. It just means that given Sellars’s claims, we cannot simply
exclude that even these concepts might have practically more adequate successors at the ideal end of inquiry.

artefacts and only the most general practical statements about them. In addition, the respective
concepts might not be ultimately practically adequate. This strikes me as much weaker than
what deVries wants to claim.
Sellars’s ideas about the role of science in establishing practical truths are, of course, highly
abstract, radical, and potentially problematic. But if we want to argue for a Sellarsian notion of
practical truth which ensures the ultimate survival of commonsense concepts, we cannot ignore
these ideas. An advocate of deVries’s approach would have to show how she accommodates
Sellars’s claims.
There might be a possible third option for specifying a sense of commonsense privilege in
the practical domain. Even if science establishes the assertibility of practical statements determining ultimately practically adequate concepts, this assertibility still depends on our aims to
lead a satisfying life or to foster the common welfare. On Sellars’s conception, science derives
practical statements from these two overarching aims. There might be room for an argument
that these overarching goals are necessarily connected to a commonsense understanding of ourselves and the world (e.g., because only persons might have such goals). However, this seems to
be a minimal asymmetry in favour of commonsense concerning practical truth. The content of
the respective practical concepts could still be established through scientific inquiry. They might
be “perspectival”, as deVries says, and dependent on our very general, overarching interests,
but in what sense this would make them commonsense concepts would need to be spelled out
more precisely.
My argument is not that our ultimate practical concepts must be scientific concepts for
Sellars. The point is merely that there seems to be no straightforward reason to assume that, in
principle, they would have to be commonsense concepts. A strict opposition of commonsense
and scientific concepts does not seem to be reasonable in the first place, at least not in a practical domain like the one of artefacts.
I do not claim to have conclusively shown that the notion of practical truth is not sufficient
to defend the ultimate legitimacy of practical commonsense concepts in Sellars’s framework.
What I want to emphasise, however, is that more argument is needed on the part of an advocate
of deVries’s approach. It is not obvious that there is a principled and substantial privilege for
common sense in practical matters for Sellars. And without this privilege it is hard to see how
the notion of practical truth could secure an ultimate legitimacy for practical commonsense
concepts. The character of ultimate practical concepts will differ, of course, from the descriptive
concepts at Sellars’s ideal end of inquiry. But it is not self-evident that, just for this reason, they
are commonsense concepts.
6 | CONCLUSION
DeVries introduces his notion of practical reality to show that Sellars has an implicit tendency
to acknowledge the ultimate legitimacy of practical concepts and maybe thereby also the ultimate legitimacy of a large class of commonsense concepts. I have tried to show that the notion
of practical reality is not necessary to defend the ultimate legitimacy of practical concepts in
Sellars’s system. This makes it reasonable to size deVries’s claim down to a suggestion about
practical truth. But whereas there may be support in Sellars for the idea that there will be ultimate practical truths, and thus ultimately legitimate practical concepts, it is not self-evident that
these concepts would have to be commonsense concepts.
Nevertheless, deVries’s suggestion throws light on possible aspects of Sellars’s ideal conceptual scheme which usually go unmentioned. Sellars’s conception of the conceptual tools at our
disposal at the ideal end of scientific inquiry may have been richer, at least later in his career,
than it is often portrayed. These tools seem to comprise practical concepts like artefact concepts. They might therefore include “perspectival” concepts—“perspectival” in the sense of

being grounded in our most general interests. However, what our more specific needs and interests really are, and here Sellars’s vision possibly remained austere, may itself be a question for
science to answer.
