## Part IV — Science and the Mind (Essays 12–14): what you’re about to do

Part IV contains three essays: **(12) “Phenomenalism,” (13) “The Identity Approach to the Mind-Body Problem,” (14) “Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man.”**

A good way to read Part IV as a single arc:

* **Essay 12**: dismantles two seductive “sense-data-first” pictures (classical phenomenalism + a hypothetico‑deductive successor) and motivates Sellars’s **direct realism** with **causal** (not epistemic) mediation by impressions + a normative/epistemic notion of “directness.”
* **Essay 13**: asks whether conscious “raw feels” can be **identified** with brain states. He rejects several versions, and tentatively accepts a **weak** identity picture—while insisting that the “logical space” of raw feels will **reappear** (transposed, not eliminated) in any adequate science of brains.
* **Essay 14**: zooms out: philosophy’s job is to understand how everything “hangs together” via a **synoptic / stereoscopic** integration of the **manifest image** and the **scientific image**—two comprehensive “pictures” that both claim reality-status and yet pull against one another.

Below are granular notes for **12–14 in one pass**.

# Essay 12 — “Phenomenalism” (1963)

## 1) The target: two “sense-contents-first” programs

### A. Classical phenomenalism (the “translation” dream)

The starting thesis: **physical objects are patterns of actual and possible sense contents**.

Sellars’s big complaint is not simply “phenomenalism is false,” but: you can’t make the program work because the notion of **possible sense contents** becomes **circular** (you secretly re-import physical-object concepts in order to cash out “possible”).

### B. “New phenomenalism” / hypothetico‑deductive phenomenalism (the “theory” dream)

A historically popular retreat move is: even if translation is impossible, maybe physical objects are a **theory** inferred from sense contents (a neo‑Lockean hypothetico‑deductive maneuver). Sellars characterizes this as the view that the physical-object framework is “deduced” (in a scientific-theory sense) from a base of sense contents.

**Key Sellars move:** this “new phenomenalism” only works if classical phenomenalism works. If the physical-object framework is really a theory in the relevant hypothetico‑deductive sense, you need inductive generalizations *stated purely in sense‑content terms*, and Sellars argues that idea is a mistake—so the “new” view either collapses back into the “old” or loses its footing.

He puts it starkly: **the success of the New Phenomenalism presupposes the success of the old; hence the New Phenomenalism is “either mistaken or superfluous.”**

---

## 2) A crucial detour: three theories of “sense contents” (and why one is poison for classical phenomenalism)

Sellars distinguishes different conceptions of what it is to “have a sensation / sense content.”

One especially important point: if you understand “sense content exists” as **“it appears to someone that there is a physical object somewhere”**, then classical phenomenalism becomes obviously circular: how can physical objects be built out of sense contents if the *existence* of the sense content already presupposes “appearing physical object”?

He allows that “whenever it appears to S that there is a red triangular physical object … S has a sensation of a red triangle,” but insists that if phenomenalism is to be “live,” that linkage can’t be taken as mere identity-in-meaning; it must be synthetic—and that already pressures what “sense contents” are supposed to be.

**Reader’s checkpoint:** whenever you see Sellars toggling between “seems there is a red triangle *there*” and “I have a visual impression of a red triangle,” track which conceptual resources are being presupposed.

---

## 3) The “possible sense contents” problem (where the classical program breaks)

Sellars’s diagnosis: classical phenomenalism needs *possible* sense contents to make physical objects into stable patterns across unperceived cases. But what are “possible” sense contents?

He pushes a deflationary moral with an analogy: don’t reify “possible skids” as mysterious objects; instead see them as tied to **conditional/general truths** plus the **inductive** support we have for those conditionals.

The important upshot for phenomenalism: once you understand “possible sense contents” via conditionals and inductive backing, you’re quickly tempted (or forced) to bring in the very physical-object talk you hoped to *construct* out of sense contents—hence the noncircularity problem the editors highlight.

---

## 4) Sellars’s alternative: Direct realism + causal (not epistemic) mediation

Sellars’s “What, then, is the alternative?” answer: affirm that physical objects are **really and directly perceived**, *without* conceding that only physical-object facts can be directly known. Direct knowledge can also include “seems” facts and facts about one’s **visual impressions**.

### Directness is normative, not psychological

Sellars insists: “direct” knowing isn’t merely “not inferred” as a mental process; it’s about what one has a **right** to believe. Direct knowing that *p* is tied to the way the thought that *p* occurred—what he calls **trans‑level credibility** and “trans‑level inference.”

This is classic Sellars: epistemic statuses (knowing, being entitled) are not “bare givens”; they involve rule-governed standing in the space of reasons.

### Mediation is causal rather than epistemic

The editors’ summary emphasizes that for Sellars: perception is mediated by sense impressions, but the mediation is **causal**, not **epistemic**—so impressions are not “the objects we really know,” but part of the causal story that enables direct empirical knowledge (and, with training, direct knowledge *of* impressions too).

---

## 5) “Beyond direct realism”: a Kantian turn + realism about theory

In the “Kantian critique” section, Sellars says: even the broad “phenomenalism” idea that things are, in standard circumstances, what they seem to be has a momentum that “must sweep away even this broad sense.”

He then revisits what theories do and a positivist temptation: treat theoretical entities as mere “computational devices” for deriving observation-framework consequences. Sellars grants that if the observation framework supports inductive generalizations whose variance is purely “epistemic,” a positivist reading is hard to avoid—but he immediately asks whether we must grant that antecedent.

So the back half of the essay is also about **scientific realism** (when and why theoretical posits deserve “real existence” talk), not only about perception.

---

## 6) The “radical thesis” (as the editors frame it): macro vs micro worlds + “sensa”

The editors highlight a late, striking suggestion: the familiar macrophysical world is “analogous to Kant’s phenomenal realm” and microphysical entities are “analogous to Kant’s noumenal realm,” so “strictly speaking, macrophysical entities do not exist.”

They also note Sellars gestures toward a successor concept to sense impressions—**“sensa”**—to help reconcile that radical thesis with his direct realism.

Take this as: *this is where Sellars is trying to fuse perception, theory, and Kantian themes into one map*—even if (as the editors remark) it’s not fully clear how the reconciliation is supposed to go.

---

## 7) Essay 12 — quick “what to walk away with”

* **Two temptations** (translate physical talk into sense talk; or treat physical talk as hypothetico‑deductive theory built on sense talk) both fail; the “new” temptation leans on what the “old” temptation needed but couldn’t supply.
* A credible alternative is **direct realism** where impressions mediate causally, and “directness” is ultimately about **entitlement** and **trans‑level credibility**, not a mythic Given.

---

# Essay 13 — “The Identity Approach to the Mind-Body Problem” (1965)

## 1) What “identity theory” is (Sellars’s precise target)

Sellars frames the identity approach (in one core form) as:

* **Raw feels are identical with brain states**, not merely that the same thing (a person) has both a feel and a brain state, but that the **characteristics** are identical—often put as: raw feel **universals** are identical with certain brain-state universals (he cites Feigl).

He also flags an internal tension: this approach tends to treat raw-feel facts as **“given” in the classical sense** (i.e., directly present), which sits uneasily with broader Sellarsian anti‑Given themes (and becomes important later in the essay).

---

## 2) Two big versions: “weak but plausible” vs “strong and exciting”

### A. Weak / “true but uninteresting” identity: raw feels as states of the empirical nervous system

Sellars argues that raw feels can’t be identical with universals expressed by ordinary **empirical** predicates defined via publicly observable features—because raw-feel predicates pick out “pure episodes” that (in the classical picture) are “given” to the subject.

But he then proposes something like: it is legitimate to think of raw feels as properties of the **person qua empirical nervous system**—a “core person” (the nervous system, “clothed” in other ways). Only a Cartesian would resist this; it’s congenial to more Aristotelian/Strawsonian pictures of persons as natural beings in the world.

This is “identity-ish,” but not the ambitious reductive identification people often want.

### B. Strong / “exciting but (Sellars suspects) false” identity: raw feels = future theoretical neuroscience predicates

Sellars then treats the more ambitious view: a future theoretical science of brain activity might introduce microphysical predicates, and we “discover” those universals are identical with raw-feel universals. He is “tempted” to say no—and he reframes the issue as: would an adequate brain theory contain predicates with the **same use** as raw-feel predicates?

---

## 3) Three objections (and the identity theorist’s replies)

Sellars lists (at least) three problems with the “exciting” version, and immediately sketches how an identity theorist might respond:

1. **Avowal-role problem**: theoretical predicates wouldn’t play the special “avowal/report” role raw-feel predicates have; reply: training could give them that avowal use.

2. **Theory-role problem**: raw-feel predicates don’t have the theoretical-use role brain predicates would; reply: they *do* have a theoretical role in how we ascribe states to others (not just in first-person avowal).

3. **Category / subject problem**: scientific predicates apply to systems of scientific objects, not to single “persons” as logical subjects; reply: identity theory implies persons are systems of scientific objects; the “category” worry is a reshuffling worry, not an outright refutation.

The deeper Sellarsian theme underneath: whether identities are *discoveries* depends on how the relevant predicates are fixed by their **conceptual roles** (their use in explanation, prediction, avowal, etc.).

---

## 4) The chemistry analogy: how “identifications” can be partly *made* (via bridge principles)

Sellars carefully analyzes a model case: the integration of thermodynamics/chemistry with microphysics.

He emphasizes: in the theoretical “micro” framework, properties and relations are introduced in terms of their contribution to a **theory** (and its explanatory/predictive roles). Then one writes **bridge laws** connecting old macro-predicates to new theoretical predicates, and in that way the latter can inherit the use of the former.

Crucially, he suggests that, in such integrations, the “identification” is not a simple empirical discovery like “two labels for one pre-fixed thing,” but involves a rational reconstruction in which the *meanings / roles* of terms get adjusted so that a smooth integration is possible. That’s why he can say, in effect: the identities are **not discovered “straightforwardly”**; they’re secured by a methodological/conceptual retooling (bridge laws + redefined theoretical primitives).

Then he asks the key question: **can anything like this move work for raw feels?**

---

## 5) Sellars’s bottom line: accept only the weak form; keep the “logical space” of raw feels

Sellars ends by saying (roughly):

* We should accept identity theory **only in the weak form** (raw feels as states/properties of the person as an empirical nervous system).
* The “logical space” of raw feels will **reappear** in a mature science—**“transposed” but not “reduced”**.

And he makes a very Sellarsian diagnosis of why raw-feel talk is so sticky:

* raw feels are *not* just brute “given” episodes;
* they are (common-sense) **theoretical constructs** introduced to explain **perceptual propositional attitudes**;
* they are tied to the language of **perceptible qualities**; and he defends a kind of **concept empiricism** against “abstraction” stories.

So Essay 13 is not “reductionism yay/nay” so much as: *how conceptual role, theoretical posits, and scientific integration constrain what “identity” could amount to*.

---

# Essay 14 — “Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man” (1962)

## 1) Philosophy’s job: synoptic understanding, not a special “topic”

Sellars’s famous framing: philosophy is about **getting the big picture**, a reflective “know your way around” competence at the level of the whole. He says philosophy’s aim is a **“synoptic vision.”**

And the special problem for the contemporary philosopher is: we don’t just face one complex picture, but two (indeed, many)—and we need a “stereoscopic” fusion of two comprehensive perspectives: the **manifest** and the **scientific** images of man‑in‑the‑world.

### “Images” are real, public, and methodologically bracketable

He stresses that calling them “images” doesn’t deny their reality-status. He explicitly invokes Husserl’s idea of **“bracketing”**: turning these ways of experiencing/conceiving the world into objects of philosophical scrutiny and evaluation.

---

## 2) The manifest image: refined common sense + persons + normativity

Sellars treats the manifest image as a refinement of the original framework in which humans first became self-conscious as “man‑in‑the‑world.”

When he gets concrete about what’s “basic” in the manifest image, it includes **persons, animals, lower forms of life, and “merely material” things** (stones, rivers, etc.).

### A crucial methodological distinction inside the manifest image

He distinguishes **correlational** refinement (inductive discovery of regularities among perceptibles) from **postulational** theory construction (positing imperceptibles to explain). The manifest image is the correlational+categorial refinement of the original; the scientific image is the “postulational” picture built from theoretical posits.

---

## 3) The perennial philosophy: when manifest image becomes “the map of reality”

Sellars introduces “the perennial philosophy” as: **the manifest image endorsed as real**, with science treated as adding detail to that already-correct large-scale map.

He says this yields a distortion like looking through a stereoscope with one eye dominating: the manifest image “dominates and mislocates” the scientific image.

But he immediately adds: if Spinoza’s stereoscopic fusion is one where the scientific image dominates, Sellars’s own use of the stereoscope analogy implies that **the manifest image is not “overwhelmed”** in the synthesis he’s after.

That’s a big interpretive flag: *Sellars is not just saying “science replaces common sense.”* He’s insisting on an integration where something essential from the manifest survives.

---

## 4) The scientific image: many partial images → an integrated idealization that becomes a rival

Sellars insists there are many scientific images of man (physics, biochemistry, physiology, behaviorism, social science…), and “the” scientific image is an **idealized integration** of these frameworks.

He highlights a crucial tension:

* **Methodologically**, each theory is built “within” the manifest image and presupposes the intersubjectively accessible world of perceptibles.
* **Substantively**, the integrated scientific image **purports to be complete**—“the whole truth”—and therefore presents itself as a **rival image**. From its point of view, the manifest image becomes an “inadequate but pragmatically useful likeness.”

And the manifest/perennial tradition pushes back: the scientific image can’t replace the manifest without rejecting its own foundation.

### Integration and “identity” across sciences

Sellars notes that some integrations look relatively straightforward, e.g., unifying biochemical and physical images by equating biochemical objects with complex patterns of physical objects—an “identity” at the level of theoretical entities, even though the sciences remain methodologically distinct.

That remark dovetails directly with Essay 13’s question: *can we do an “identity” integration for mind/brain the way we do for chemistry/physics?*—and if not, why not?

---

## 5) The endgame (as he signals it): a true stereoscopic view

Sellars explicitly says he will conclude with comments on “the respective contributions” of the two images to a unified vision, which is “the aim of philosophy.”

So your reading task in Essay 14 is to track two things:

1. **What must survive from the manifest image** (especially persons, norms, and the “properly human level” that the manifest image still largely contains).
2. **What the scientific image claims** when it presents itself as a complete, rival framework—and what kind of “completion” that could be if the manifest isn’t simply eliminated.

---

# A compact Part IV “lock-together” synthesis (12 → 13 → 14)

* **(12) Phenomenalism**: rejects the idea that epistemology/metaphysics can be built by starting with “sense contents” as an autonomous foundation; directs you toward (i) **direct realism**, (ii) causal mediation by impressions, and (iii) a norm-governed account of “directness” (trans-level credibility).
* **(13) Identity**: asks what becomes of conscious episodes (raw feels) under scientific integration; concludes we may accept a weak identity (feels as states of the empirical nervous system) but must preserve the “logical space” of feels in a mature science (transposed, not reduced).
* **(14) Scientific Image**: tells you what *kind* of philosophical project these debates belong to: fusing two comprehensive, reality-claiming images into a stereoscopic whole—without letting either “dominate” in a distorting way.

---

# Quick discussion / seminar questions (one set for all three essays)

1. **“Possible sense contents”:** When Sellars analogizes to “possible skids,” what exactly is he trying to block—reifying possibilities, or something deeper about the role of conditionals + induction?

2. **Directness as entitlement:** How does “trans-level credibility” change what it means to say perception is “direct”? What would count as the *rules* underwriting that credibility?

3. **Weak identity’s cost:** If raw feels are properties of “core persons” (nervous systems), what happens to first-person authority and the avowal/report distinction?

4. **Is “identity” discovery or construction?** In the chemistry analogy, Sellars suggests identities are secured via bridge principles + retooling of conceptual roles. Is the same kind of role-preserving translation imaginable for raw feels? Why/why not?

5. **Stereoscopic fusion:** What exactly must survive from the manifest image for Sellars—persons? normativity? “the properly human level”?—and how can it survive if the scientific image presents itself as a “complete” rival?

---

If you want, next I can do a **Part IV synthesis page** (one page) that treats 12–14 as a single argument: *anti–sense-data foundationalism → direct realism + scientific realism → weak identity without eliminativism → stereoscopic manifest/scientific integration as philosophy’s task.*

## Part IV synthesis: one continuous argument (12 → 13 → 14)

Part IV (“Science and the Mind”) is explicitly the trio **(12) “Phenomenalism,” (13) “The Identity Approach to the Mind-Body Problem,” (14) “Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man.”** 
Read as a single arc, it’s Sellars’s “anti-Given” program—now applied to perception, consciousness, and the place of persons in nature—culminating in the famous **manifest/scientific image** framework.

---

### 1) Anti–sense-data foundationalism (Essay 12: why phenomenalism can’t be the foundation)

Sellars’s starting diagnosis: both classical phenomenalism and its “new” hypothetico-deductive descendant try to make the **sense-content framework** do foundational work it can’t do.

* The **New Phenomenalism** (physical objects as a theory “deduced” from a base of sense contents) only works if it can be construed on the model where theory↔observation is tied by inductive generalizations *stated purely in sense-content terms*. Sellars argues this is a mistake. 
* He then gives the decisive verdict: because the success of the New Phenomenalism presupposes the success of the old, **“the New Phenomenalism is either mistaken or superfluous,”** and if it is mistaken then neither Classical Phenomenalism nor that hypothetico-deductive “realism” (in the anti-realist sense) is available as an alternative. 

That is the Part IV “anti-foundation” kick-off: **you can’t build the world out of sense contents** (or out of their “possible” variants) without circularity or covert importation of the very physical-object framework you meant to derive.

---

### 2) Direct realism + scientific realism (Essay 12: what replaces the failed foundation)

Sellars’s alternative begins as a kind of **direct realism**:

* **Physical objects are “really and directly perceived.”** 
* But this does *not* force the idea that only physical-object facts can be directly known: it is compatible with directly knowing that *there seems to be* a red triangular object, and (Sellars argues) compatible with directly knowing that one is having a visual impression (e.g., of a red triangle). 

The critical Sellarsian twist is how he cashes out “direct”:

* “Direct” can’t be “no inference happened” as a psychological event; **knowledge is entitlement** (“one only knows what one has a right to think”), so direct knowing is a normative status tied to how the thought occurred—what he calls **“trans-level credibility”** and the corresponding **trans-level inference schema**. 

So the Essay-12 upshot is not merely “direct realism”: it’s **direct realism without the Given**. Sense impressions can still be part of the story, but their role is **causal rather than epistemic** (they’re not “the things we really know” that form a base).

This also sets the stage for scientific realism: once phenomenalist reductions fail, the question becomes how theoretical posits, levels, and scientific explanation integrate with the manifest world—exactly the “images” question of Essay 14.

---

### 3) Weak identity without eliminativism (Essay 13: locating sensation/feeling in nature)

Essay 13 takes the “science and the mind” problem to its most tempting form: **identity theory**.

Sellars’s baseline formulation (following Feigl): the identity theory says that **“raw feels” are identical with “brain states,”** and not merely co-instantiated, but identical as characteristics/universals. 

He then distinguishes a “large-scale” identity that is (in his view) basically true but philosophically unexciting:

* Treat the person as a **nervous system “clothed in flesh and bones,”** introduce the “core person” (the empirical nervous system), and say that **raw feels (and even thoughts) are primarily states of core persons** and only derivatively of the clothed person. 
* In that sense, it’s plausible that raw feels are “brain states”; only someone demanding distinct logical subjects (a Cartesian dualist) would resist. 

But Sellars’s real interest is: can the *exciting* identity claim work—raw-feel predicates being replaced by future theoretical neuro-predicates with the “same use”? He is strongly tempted to say no (it has an “implausible ring”), because the conceptual roles of raw-feel predicates (avowal, reporting, their place in our overall conceptual scheme) are not easily reproduced by purely theoretical primitives. 

Here’s the crucial “non-eliminativist” hinge:

* Even if we accept identity only in the weak/core-person sense, Sellars insists that **a theory adequate to explaining core persons must contain a “categorical transformation” of raw-feel predicates**—the “logical space” of raw feels will **“reappear transposed but unreduced.”** 

So Part IV’s identity story is not: “science will eliminate qualia.” It’s: **a mature science must somehow internalize the role-structure (logical space) our raw-feel talk occupies**, even if the ultimate ontology is neurophysiological.

---

### 4) Why all this belongs to philosophy: stereoscopic integration of images (Essay 14)

Essay 14 gives the meta-frame: philosophy’s job is to articulate how the whole hangs together by integrating two “images” of man-in-the-world.

Sellars explicitly proposes that integrating theoretical science with refined common sense is not best treated as a piecemeal stitching-together (first physics/common sense, then psychology/common sense), but rather as fusing **“two whole ways of seeing the sum of things”** into a **“stereoscopic”** view. 

Two key guardrails matter for reading Part IV as a unity:

1. **The manifest image cannot simply be obliterated.**
   Sellars emphasizes that the *very analogy of stereoscopic vision* implies the manifest image is **not overwhelmed** in the synthesis. 
   And he says the stakes are existentially high: since humans conceive themselves in terms of the manifest image, **if it doesn’t survive in the synoptic view, “man himself would not survive.”** 

2. **The scientific image presses a rival claim to completeness.**
   Sellars characterizes “the scientific image” as an idealized, still-developing integrated framework, contrasted with the manifest image (and its basic objects, including **persons**). 
   The philosophical task is to say how the mind (including sensation/feeling) can have a place in that image without losing what the manifest image gets right about persons, normativity, and social life.

---

## The Part IV “baton pass” (the promised chain)

* **Anti–sense-data foundationalism:** New phenomenalism collapses because it presupposes what it needs (sense-content generalizations “independent” of physical-thing talk). 
* **Direct realism + (implicit) scientific realism:** we must affirm direct perception of physical objects while treating “directness” as a normative entitlement (trans-level credibility), not a Given. 
* **Weak identity without eliminativism:** accept the “core person” move (raw feels as states of the empirical nervous system), but insist the “logical space” of raw feels must reappear—transposed, not erased—in any adequate brain theory.  
* **Stereoscopic synoptic task:** philosophy’s job is to integrate the manifest and scientific images into a unified vision where the manifest isn’t simply overwritten.  

If you want, next I can do the same “one-page synthesis” for **Part V (Kant)** showing how Essays 15–17 function as Sellars’s explicit “Kantian stage” account of receptivity/spontaneity, imagination, and why the anti-Given program wants transcendental (or “transcendental linguistics”) machinery.

## Part V — KANT (Essays 15–17): Notes + one-page synthesis

**Part V (“Kant”) in this volume contains three essays:**
15 **“…this I or he or it (the thing) which thinks…”**; 16 **Some Remarks on Kant’s Theory of Experience**; 17 **The Role of Imagination in Kant’s Theory of Experience** 

The editors frame these as the “Kantian stage” culmination of the whole book: Sellars explicitly hoped his work would help move analytic philosophy “from its Humean into its Kantian stage.” 

---

# Essay 15 — **“…this I or he or it (the thing) which thinks…”**

### 1) Why the Paralogisms matter: rational psychology vs transcendental psychology

Sellars opens by locating his “text” in Kant’s **Paralogisms**, where Kant critiques **Rational Psychology**. 
He immediately distinguishes:

* a legitimate **“transcendental psychology”** (miscast as a science of pure reason) concerned with “four paralogisms … concerning the nature of our thinking being,” and
* **Rational Psychology**, which is a *distortion* of that enterprise and only belongs (properly) within the principles of the **Transcendental Analytic**. 

This sets the governing question: *What can we know a priori about “what sort of being an I is,” without appeal to experience?* 
Sellars says Kant allows a restricted body of a priori knowledge here (transcendental psychology), but denies that Rational Psychology can “tell us what an I is ‘in itself’” by making “I think” its “sole text.” 

### 2) The transcendental unity of apperception as *the* central pivot

Sellars flags the **transcendental unity of apperception** as key to both the Deduction and the Paralogisms—“perhaps, the central concept of the Critique.” 
He says he won’t translate it into “congenial terms” here (it would take him into “epistemic logic,” suggested as the contemporary counterpart of Kant’s transcendental logic). 

### 3) A core anti-reification principle about thought-unity: not “bundles of thoughts”

One of Sellars’s most load-bearing clarifications is this contrast:

* **“an I thinks of a manifold”**
  is *not* to be confused with
* **“an I has a manifold of thoughts.”** 

So, “thinking that Socrates is wise” isn’t a mere coexistence of a thought of Socrates + a thought of wisdom. The “ways in which many thinkings constitute one thinking” are the **forms of thought**—e.g. the **categories**. 
Sellars calls recognizing the radical difference between categorial forms and matter-of-factual relationships the **pons asinorum** of critical philosophy. 

### 4) The phenomenal world’s “larger form”: *an I thinking a spatiotemporal-causal world*

Sellars says Kant’s “unrestricted” principle about thinking becomes, in the Analytic, the clue to the **form of the phenomenal world**: it is a represented world, with Space, Time, and the Categories as its “forms”—but not as a mere list. Rather they are “moments” in the larger form:
**“An I thinking a complex spatial-temporal-causal system of states of affairs … (the synthetic unity of apperception).”** 
From synthetic unity it follows analytically that “the I which thinks α is identical with the I which thinks β” (analytic unity of apperception). 

### 5) The “I” as an empty representation; the transcendental subject = X

Sellars quotes Kant’s sharpening: Rational Psychology’s “sole text” is “I think,” and Kant says we can assign no other basis than the “completely empty” representation “I.” 
Kant adds we can’t even call it a concept—only a bare consciousness accompanying all concepts—and through “this I or he or it (the thing) which thinks” nothing is represented but a **transcendental subject of thoughts = X**, known only through its predicate-thoughts. 

### 6) Predication: Kant *doesn’t* need a “bare substratum” ontology

Sellars addresses a common misread: Kant is *not* committed to a substratum theory where every predicate fits “x has attribute A,” culminating in “bare particulars.” 
Sellars insists Kant explicitly warns against construing predication as inherence between “accidents” and substance; instead an “accident” is “the way in which the existence of a substance is determined.” 

### 7) Inner experience, objective time, and a key Kantian pressure point

Sellars reconstructs Kant’s dilemma from the First Analogy: if **all change** is change of substance, then either mental acts are states of material substance, or the states of the empirical self are not alterations/in time. 
Kant avoids “reductive materialism,” considers a Strawsonian “appearance” route, but **opts for a dualistic model** and must explain how non-corporeal alterations can be in an **objective time order**—by making the temporal objectivity of the mental **derivative from material events**. 

Now Sellars turns to Kant’s self-knowledge story: introspection involves **passivity**, and Kant treats “inner sense” as the mind being caused to represent something—only now the cause is one of our own states. 
So “inner perception” yields representations of the form: **“I have just (a moment ago) represented such and such.”** 

### 8) Sellars’s critique: Kant confuses determinism with “foreign causation” passivity

Sellars explicitly calls out a confusion: the fact that a state is a physically necessary consequence of a prior state **does not** mean it was caused by a “foreign cause.” 
He adds: “The past is not something with respect to which we are passive,” and the concept of a **closed system** shows it’s a mistake to think the explanation of a system’s present state lies entirely in “other things.” 
So Kant would need a special reason for taking inner-perceived self-states as essentially passive with respect to “foreign causes.” 

Sellars’s deeper point: a passivity model may fit perceptual representation, but it doesn’t fit our self-knowledge of **philosophizing, plotting, reflecting**, etc.; and even perceptual experience isn’t purely passive (it involves choosing what to look at). 

### 9) “This I or he or it…”: personhood, imputability, freedom

Sellars returns to the “it” in Kant’s text. He argues Kant is *not* implying the thinker is a bare substratum; the noumenal subject of thoughts is a thinker. 
But Kant leaves open whether it’s a *person* in the full sense: he defines a “thing” (in the relevant sense) as **“that which is not capable of any imputation.”** 
So the thinking being might be an **automaton spirituale / cogitans**, a thinking mechanism, and the “more” we take ourselves to be might be a delusion. 

This is where freedom enters: Kant hints at freedom and attributes at least **relative spontaneity / relative autonomy** to the noumenal self, and Sellars says the First Critique tacitly presupposes purposive thinking, with practical reason becoming explicit only later (Dialectic). 

### 10) Essay 15’s “Sellarsian” moral

At the end Sellars explicitly connects Kant’s challenge to *both* camps: those tempted by rational psychology must take the scientific image seriously, but scientific realists must also find room for **autonomy of reason** and “the reality of the moral point of view.”

# Essay 16 — **Some Remarks on Kant’s Theory of Experience**

### 1) “Nature … exists as a system of representations”: what could that even mean?

Sellars begins with Kant’s refrain that Nature and Space/Time exist as a system of “representations,” and immediately asks: does Kant mean representings (mental acts) or representeds? 
He answers: not “nature = system of mental acts.” Nature includes representings (e.g. sensory representings as states of the empirical self), but its primary constituents are material things/events, and Kant would agree it’s absurd to treat a material event as a representing (or a mental act as having shape/size). 

### 2) Kant’s anti–sense-datum moral in the Refutation of Idealism

Sellars emphasizes Kant’s Refutation of Idealism contrast:

* material objects/events: extended, located in space
* sense impressions: neither extended nor in space (though temporally located) 
  Kant’s aim is to attack the Cartesian picture that perceptual experience is an intuitive awareness of nonspatial impressions; spatial structures are as “directly or intuitively represented” as the nonspatial states of the empirical self. 

### 3) Space & time as “forms of intuition” = logical powers of “this”-representings

Sellars gives a striking reconstruction: no representing is a mere “this” label; space/time are forms of intuition because the **logical powers of “this” representings** are specified via concepts of relative spatiotemporal location. 
He insists we must distinguish spatiotemporal concepts’ transcendental/epistemic function (forms of representing) from their empirical function in ordinary historical judgments. 

In “linguistic terms,” this means spatiotemporal predicates are essential not only to object-language talk but to **metalinguistic** talk about the logical/epistemic powers of forms—demonstratives and tenses, whose logical powers depend on their occurrence in space/time. 

### 4) Intuitions as demonstrative *conceptual* episodes (individual concepts)

Sellars interprets intuitions as a special class of nongeneral conceptual representings (individual concepts) like **“this-line”** (vs “the line I drew yesterday”). 
This helps make sense of Kant’s claim that “intuitions of a manifold” have **categorial form**: “this-line” has subject–predicate form even if it isn’t yet a judgment; and “This book is red” has subject–predicate form “twice” (paraphrasable as “This is a book and it is red”). 

### 5) Receptivity vs spontaneity via Sellars’s language-entry transitions

On this reading, the representings “brought about by the affection of receptivity” would already be broadly conceptual, which forces a radical reinterpretation of receptivity/spontaneity. 
Sellars then makes the key bridge: compare Kantian affection to **language entry transitions**—e.g. a red object in sunlight evokes “this is red” from someone who knows the language. Such an utterance is not a mere conditioned response; it depends on the environment **and** the perceiver’s conceptual set. 
To know the language of perception is to be able to let one’s thoughts be guided by the world (as contrasted with free association/daydreaming/storytelling). 

And (Sellars says) Kant’s contention is that the conceptual structures developed under reality’s influence are of a piece with those developed freely in imagination—counting vs “counting” as rehearsal; perceiving a triangle vs imagining a particular triangle—except that in receptivity we do it **as guided** by the objects represented. 

### 6) “Transcendental linguistics”: Sellars’s explicit closing move

Sellars proposes an explicit discipline: **transcendental linguistics**, distinguished from empirical linguistics because it studies language as conforming to epistemic norms (formulated in the language) and it is general like Carnap’s “general syntax,” aiming at features common to the epistemic functioning of any language in any possible world. 
He then equates this with a slogan: epistemology “in the new way of words” is the theory of what it is to be a language about a world in which it is used. 
And he says Kant’s transcendental psychology is “the heart” of Kant’s system because it seeks the general features any conceptual system must have to generate knowledge of a world to which it belongs. 

He closes with a Sellarsian pressure against Kant’s official agnosticism: if we have no determinate concepts of things-in-themselves, then rules of the form “(ceteris paribus) one ought to respond to φ items with conceptual acts of kind C” could never function as criticizable norms—“only God could envisage” the ought-to-be’s for our conceptual responses. 
He ties this to Kant’s “inner-linguistics” (innatist transmission): Kant has no place for the role of ought-to-be’s of language entry transitions in cultural transmission.

# Essay 17 — **The Role of Imagination in Kant’s Theory of Experience**

### 1) Method and goal: “ostensibly independent theory” that captures Kant’s gist

Sellars says his aim is a sympathetic account of productive imagination in perceptual experience, but he won’t do line-by-line exegesis; instead he’ll construct an “ostensibly independent” theory that “just so happens” to contain the gist of Kant’s scheme, and he will “warp and slant” as needed so long as it illuminates the text. 

He begins from phenomenological reflection: our access to the external world is through perception, so examining perceptual structure should reveal categories and how objects and perceivers come together. 
He starts with vision: experience presents itself as direct awareness of complex physical structure and as perspectival. 

### 2) Image-models and the key constructivist claim

Sellars introduces **image-models** (emphasizing their perspectival “point-of-viewish” structure) and says the construction is a unified process guided by sensory input **and** background beliefs/memories/expectations; this ability-complex is what Kant calls **productive** (vs reproductive) imagination. 

He insists: what we are directly aware of in perceptual consciousness are image-models, but we are not aware of them **as** image-models; that’s a theoretical interpretation reached by reflection (aided by “scientific lore”). 

He adds a crucial corollary: constructing image-models of objects goes with constructing an image-model of the perceiver’s body (self-in-environment). The perspectival character motivates the thesis of the transcendental ideality of the image-model world; image-models are “phenomenal objects,” whose esse is to be proxies, and whose being is that of complex patterns of sensory states constructed by productive imagination. 

### 3) Perspectival models vs non-perspectival objects

Even though image-models are perspectival, the objects in terms of which they are conceptualized are not (apples are not “point-of-viewish” entities). So we must distinguish objects-as-conceived from the image-models constructed. 

### 4) Schema, recipe, and the “dog” model

Sellars defines productive imagination as a unique blend of:

* forming images according to a **recipe**, and
* conceiving objects in a way that supplies recipes. 
  Kant’s concept/schema distinction (dog vs schema of dog) becomes a family of recipes for constructing image-models of perceiver-confronting-dog. 

He illustrates with development: the child lacks dog/house concepts but (for Kant) has an innate proto-framework of spatiotemporal physical objects interacting—objects capable of generating systematically varying visual inputs relative to the perceiver. 

### 5) Productive vs reproductive imagination; mediation between sensibility and understanding

Sellars’s summary passage is extremely explicit: productive imagination generates both

* the complex demonstrative conceptualization (“This red pyramid facing me edgewise”)
  and
* the simultaneous image-model (point-of-viewish model of self confronting that pyramid). 

This clarifies Kant’s contrast:

* **reproductive imagination**: association of ideas/objects, contingent on experience, presupposing objects already constituted; 
* **productive imagination**: constitution by conformity to recipe-schemata derived from concepts; 
  and shows why productive imagination mediates between sensibility and understanding (“action of the understanding on sensibility”). 

### 6) What we perceive *of* vs what we perceive *as*

Sellars ties the “as/of” distinction to:

* a complex demonstrative thought component vs
* a complex-image component. 

What we perceive **of** the object are features belonging to the image-model (common-sensible qualities/relations + perspectival structure); what we perceive the object **as** is the conceptual content of the demonstrative thought. 
He emphasizes we don’t perceive causal properties; what we see are occurrent sensible features. 

### 7) Direct link back to Sellars’s own system (as editors gloss it)

The editors explicitly say Sellars uses this essay to connect Kant to Sellars’s own topics: **‘looks’ talk**, the thesis that concepts applied to sense impressions are extensions of concepts applied to physical objects, and the diagnosis of the given as a myth—centering on perception as a blend of sense impressions and beliefs and the “image-model” notion used to explain how conceptual activity and nonconceptual sense impressions yield seamless perceptual experience.

# One-page Part V synthesis (15–17 as one continuous argument)

**Part V is Sellars’s “Kantian stage” self-portrait:** these essays show what he thinks a genuinely post-Humean, anti-Given, scientifically serious *transcendental* approach looks like. 

1. **Essay 15** diagnoses the failure mode: **Rational Psychology** tries to read metaphysical conclusions about the soul/self “in itself” from the “I think,” treating it as a special epistemic lever. Sellars follows Kant in replacing that with **transcendental psychology**—a theory of what can be known a priori about the “I” *as a necessary condition of possible experience*.  The centerpiece is the **transcendental unity of apperception**, and Sellars reconstructs it as a deep anti-bundle principle: “an I thinks of a manifold” is not “an I has a manifold of thoughts,” and the categories are forms of thought that unify contents.  That unity is what yields the form of empirical knowledge as an “I” thinking a structured spatiotemporal-causal world. 
   Sellars then pressures Kant at a key seam: Kant’s story about inner sense/inner perception tends to treat being in a deterministic order as being passive “to foreign causes,” and Sellars argues that’s a confusion—deterministic consequence is not “foreign causation,” and not all self-awareness is passive (philosophizing, deliberating, even choosing what to look at).  
   The payoff is that Kant’s “thing which thinks” passage opens into the problem of freedom: whether the thinker is imputable (a person) or merely an automaton, and how purposive autonomy enters.  

2. **Essay 16** turns that “transcendental psychology” into an account of experience: it reinterprets “Nature … as representations” in a way that preserves material reality while denying that perception is awareness of inner, nonspatial sense-data.  Sellars’s signature move is to treat **space and time as forms of intuition** by way of the **logical powers** of demonstratives (“this” representings): spatiotemporal concepts are built into the epistemic grammar of representing, not merely added as empirical predicates. 
   This naturally invites Sellars’s own vocabulary: Kantian affection of receptivity is compared to **language entry transitions** (e.g., “this is red” evoked by a red object from a trained speaker), and “receptivity” becomes “spontaneity under guidance”—a unified picture of how thought can be world-guided without being the Given.  
   Sellars ends by explicitly recasting his own project as **transcendental linguistics**—a general theory of the norms and structures any conceptual system must have to generate knowledge of a world to which it belongs. 

3. **Essay 17** supplies the missing mechanism: **productive imagination**. Instead of treating perception as (a) raw sense impressions plus (b) later conceptual interpretation, Sellars constructs a Kantian “image-model” theory where perceptual consciousness is a unified construction guided by sensory input **and** background beliefs/expectations, yielding perspectival image-models that function as proxies.   This explains how perception is simultaneously (i) direct-seeming awareness of a physical world and (ii) structured by conceptual recipe-schemata—precisely the bridge between sensibility and understanding Kant was after. 
   And (as the editors underline) Sellars uses this framework to connect Kant straight back to Sellars’s own anti-Given themes: “looks” talk, extension of physical-object concepts to sense impressions, and the myth of the given, explained via the blend of impressions and beliefs that yields seamless experience. 

**Net result:** Part V shows Kant doing (in Sellars’s hands) what Sellars wants philosophy to do: articulate the *conditions of possibility* of objective knowledge and experience—conditions that are neither Humean “given” atoms nor rationalist metaphysical leaps, but **norm-governed, role-structured capacities** (apperception, categories, receptivity-under-guidance, imagination) that can be brought into continuity with Sellars’s own “new way of words.”
