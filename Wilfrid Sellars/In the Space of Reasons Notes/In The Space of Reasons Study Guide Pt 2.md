According to the 2007 Harvard University Press collection *In the Space of Reasons: Selected Essays of Wilfrid Sellars* (ed. Kevin Scharp & Robert B. Brandom), **Part II is “Abstract Entities,”** and it contains essays **5–7**. 

Below are **granular notes for Part II, essays 5 and 6** (next time we’ll do essay 7).

---

## Part II orientation: what changes from Part I

Part I gave you Sellars’s core semantic strategy: **meaning is not a relation to “abstract meanings,” but a matter of functional role**, and abstract-sounding talk can often be unfolded into talk about linguistic/conceptual tokens (this is explicitly flagged as the bridge to Part II). 

So Part II is where Sellars starts saying, in effect:

> If you get clear on the *roles* of names/predicates/sentences, you can stop being bewitched into inflating your ontology with “properties,” “kinds,” “propositions,” etc.

Essay 5 gives a *model* of that clarity (Jumblese). Essay 6 begins the “preface to ontology”: it tries to diagnose the specific inferential/grammatical mistakes that make Platonism about abstracta feel mandatory. 

---

# Essay 5 — **“Naming and Saying”** (1962)

### 0) One-sentence core

Sellars uses a Tractatus-style picture-theory setup plus the constructed language **Jumblese** to show how confusions about **predicates vs names vs statements** drive a slide into reifying universals/abstract entities—and how a more perspicuous grammar resists that slide. 

---

## 1) The setup: two “logical atomisms” (Wittgenstein vs Bergmann)

Sellars frames the essay around a fork:

* **(1) Tractarian/Wittgenstein-style option:** the “objects” in atomic facts are *only particulars*.
* **(2) Bergmann-style option:** atomic facts contain *particular(s) + a universal*, tied by “exemplification.” 

This is already the Part II theme: *what looks like ontology* (are there universals?) is driven by *what we think our grammar forces on us*.

---

## 2) Wittgenstein’s key point: what’s “essential” in a statement is not what it superficially looks like

Sellars highlights a Tractarian claim:

* Names and statements are both “facts” in the mundane sense (they’re complex sign-designs),
* but the **parts of a name** are not parts *as signs* in the way parts of a statement are. 

Then comes the twist: if we ask what parts of “aRb” are *essential* to its saying what it says, the “obvious” answer (“a”, “R”, “b”) is, Sellars says, **not right in the deepest sense**. The “R” is involved differently: it “brings it about” that the names “a” and “b” stand in a certain dyadic arrangement. 

### Why this matters

This is Sellars pushing you toward a functional-role thought:

* The predicate-word isn’t an extra “thing” named.
* Predication is a *way the sentence works*—a role in the “language game” of asserting.

---

## 3) Jumblese: a “perspicuous language” that makes roles visible

Sellars’s pedagogical move is to imagine a language where:

* You can express “a is next to b” not by inserting a relation word, but by **spatially relating the names** themselves.
* In such a language, “relation words” drop out; what matters is the **configuration of names**. 

The editors explicitly note why this matters: Jumblese is built to be “ideally perspicuous” about the different roles of **singular terms, predicates, and sentences**, and so helps avoid a “deeply rooted constellation” of confusions. 

---

## 4) A crucial subtlety: “same ink-facts,” different *linguistic roles*

Sellars warns against a classic error: thinking that because two inscriptions are empirically similar, they must have similar *meaning roles*. He emphasizes that understanding an expression is knowing which of its many features (shape/size/style) are meaning-relevant. In Jumblese, you can have “neutral” styles that merely write a name (no assertion), and “non-neutral” styles that assert something. 

### Why this matters

It supports a Sellarsian moral:

* Ontological inflation often starts from treating a feature of a sign as if it must correspond to an extra entity.

---

## 5) Quantification + variables: where people get tempted into Bergmann

Sellars anticipates an objection: if monadic “facts” are expressed by styling a single name, how do you handle **predicate variables** (the counterparts of monadic predicate variables in Principia)? (You can boldface “x” to say “x is green,” but how do you say “a is of *some* quality?”). 

His response is to sketch a translation schema from ordinary predicate notation (“PMese”) into Jumblese that:

* keeps **names of particulars** as letters,
* but uses a variety of **neutral styles** to do the work that predicate-variables do. 

A striking upshot: in that Jumblese variant, expressions that function as *names but not statements* can nonetheless **have the “form of a statement”**—again separating visual form from functional role. 

---

## 6) The anti-reification punchline: don’t confuse (constant vs variable) with (name vs variable)

This is one of the essay’s most “Sellars-y” diagnostic maxims:

* It is “of crucial importance to ontology” **not** to confuse the contrast between **constant/variable** with the contrast between **name/variable**. 

Why? Because that confusion is precisely how you slide from:

* “we can generalize with predicate-variables”
  to:
* “predicates must be *names* of universals.”

Sellars explicitly says this slide yields the “incorrect idea” that “Green a” is a juxtaposition of two names and so would “perspicuously” say what is “unperspicuously” said by “a exemplifies green.” 

---

## 7) Wittgenstein vs Bergmann on “exemplification”

Sellars stages the contrast sharply:

* **Wittgenstein’s view:** the fact that *a is below b* is perspicuously represented by an expression consisting of **two names dyadically related**; using a 2-place predicate expression is “unperspicuous.”
* **Bergmann’s view (as Sellars presents it):** the perspicuous representation would involve **three names triadically related**, with something having the force of “exemplifies” showing up only in the “unperspicuous” version. 

Sellars then explicitly ties the disagreement to the realist/nominalist fault line: Wittgenstein = only particulars; Bergmann = particulars + universals. 

---

## 8) Study questions for Essay 5

1. Why does Sellars think Jumblese is philosophically clarifying? What specific confusions does it block? 

2. In what sense is “R” in “aRb” not an “essential part” of the statement, *even though it matters*? 

3. How does the constant/variable vs name/variable distinction undercut the inference from predicate-quantification to universals? 

---

# Essay 6 — **“Grammar and Existence: A Preface to Ontology”** (1960)

### 0) One-sentence core

Sellars attacks a “dogma” that **higher-order existential generalization** (quantifying over properties/kinds/propositions) *automatically* commits us to abstract entities; the cure is to separate (i) what existentially quantified formulas do in a language from (ii) genuine **existence statements** that use common nouns/categories. 

---

## 1) The “dogma” he targets

Sellars says it’s widely assumed that moves like:

* from **“S is white”** to **“(∃f) S is f”**
* from **“S is a man”** to **“(∃K) S is a K”**
* from **“Tom is clever or Tom is tall”** to **“(∃p) p or Tom is tall”**

commit us to **properties, kinds, propositions** (or similar abstract entities). 

He highlights the typical “informal reading” that invites the reification: reading “(∃f) S is f” as “There is an f such that S is f,” which encourages treating “f” like a *thing* to be named. 

---

## 2) A key reconstruction: treat “(∃f) S is f” as “S is something,” not “S has some property-thing”

Sellars proposes (in section III) that a better way to hear existential generalization over predicates is:

* **“S is something.”**

This is close to an idea Sellars attributes to Geach: there’s a difference between:

* **“S is something”** (a kind of schematic completion of a predicate position)
  and
* **“S has something”** (which more naturally invites object-talk).

Sellars’s point is that the *surface English paraphrase* (“there is an f…”) is what pushes you toward the “has something” picture, and that’s the source of the ontological illusion.

---

## 3) Why “category-words” and abstract singular terms are the real flashpoint

Even if we grant the above, Sellars notes: in actual philosophical/ordinary discourse we *do* talk with category words like “quality” and abstract singular terms like “triangularity.” That raises the real worry:

* Don’t we end up with “qualities” anyway?

Sellars’s answer begins by insisting that getting from “S is something” to “There are qualities/properties” requires an additional step: introducing category words and their quantifiers/variables in a particular way, which is often done *badly* (grammatical confusion again).

---

## 4) The decisive distinction: **existentially quantified formulas vs existence statements**

Sellars argues in section VI that philosophers routinely assume:

> every existentially quantified formula corresponds to an “existence statement.”

But he says there’s **no general correspondence**. 

His key criterion: **existence statements essentially involve common nouns** (category terms), e.g. “There are tame tigers.” 

That’s why, he says, it’s a mistake to “read” ordinary quantifications as existence claims like:

* “(∃x) x is white” → “There is a thing which is white”
  or
* “(∃f) S is f” → “There is a property which S has.”

Those paraphrases smuggle in the common-noun *thing/property*—and that smuggling is the ontological conjuring trick. 

---

## 5) A worked conflict: Geach and Quine on reifying properties

Sellars treats Geach as having the right *direction* (separating “is something” from “has something”) but then—Sellars argues—Geach still makes a reifying move by saying something like:

* from “Tom is tall” infer “The tallness of Tom is a property,”
  and treat that as introducing “properties” as what predicates stand for. 

Sellars is basically saying: *don’t let the grammatical availability of “the tallness of Tom” bully you into thinking you’ve discovered a new entity.* He’s angling toward the idea that these are “material-mode” ways of talking about syntactic/functional features of expressions.

---

## 6) Diagnostic tool: “question-echoing counterparts”

Sellars introduces a neat test: you can spot the difference between adjective-like and noun-like “something” by looking at their *question counterparts*.

* “Tom is **what**?” has a “quale” feel (adjectival slot),
* whereas “Tom is **a what**?” has a “quid” feel (common-noun slot).

He suggests we could mark the difference by distinct interrogatives/variables (he uses the notion of “question-echoing counterparts” to show why ordinary English tends to collapse them and thereby encourages reification). 

This is Sellars doing “conceptual therapy” with grammar.

---

## 7) The “triangularity” pivot: from grammar to (anti-)Platonism

Sellars explicitly says that abstract singular-term talk like “triangularity” doesn’t have to add new ontology; it can be unpacked as metalinguistic talk. He frames a key task as explaining the difference between:

* “Triangularity is a quality”
  and
* “‘triangular’ is an adjective.”

He says these two *seem* to report something different, but the temptation to treat the first as about a special object (“triangularity”) is part of the illusion he wants to dissolve. 

In the later retrospective section (XV), Sellars summarizes his aim: he began by arguing that “higher order” existential quantification does *not* by itself assert abstract entities, and he hopes that if abstract singular terms are only used in categorizing statements (“…is a quality,” etc.), we might relieve Platonistic anxieties by “syntactical therapy.”

---

## 8) How Essay 6 hooks into Essay 5 (and Part I)

* **Essay 5** gave you a *working model* (Jumblese) of how much metaphysics gets driven by confusing roles of expressions. One central warning there: don’t infer “two names” (particular + universal) just because your notation lets you quantify with predicate variables. 

* **Essay 6** generalizes that warning into ontology: don’t infer “there exist properties/kinds/propositions” just because you can existentially generalize over predicate positions. The “existence statement” requires the additional common-noun/category apparatus. 

* The entire move presupposes the Part I idea that **semantic explanation is functional/role-based**, and that “abstract entities” talk can often be unfolded into metalinguistic talk about expression-types/tokens and their roles. 

---

## 9) Study questions for Essay 6

1. What exactly is the “dogma” Sellars is targeting, and where does it sneak in (which paraphrase habits)? 

2. Why does Sellars insist that existence statements essentially involve *common nouns*? What breaks if you ignore that? 

3. What are “question-echoing counterparts,” and how do they help diagnose reification pressures in English? 

---

## Next step

When you’re ready, we’ll do **Essay 7 (“Abstract Entities”)**—and then (if you want) a **Part II synthesis page** showing how 5–7 form one continuous argument about how semantic clarity disciplines ontology. 

According to a document from 2007, here are **granular notes for Part II, Essay 7 (“Abstract Entities”)**, followed by a **Part II synthesis page** that shows how Essays 5–7 fit together into one continuous argument.

---

## Essay 7 — “Abstract Entities” (1963): Granular notes

### 0. Where this sits and what Sellars is trying to do

* In this volume, **Part II** is “ABSTRACT ENTITIES” and includes: (5) “Naming and Saying,” (6) “Grammar and Existence: A Preface to Ontology,” and (7) “Abstract Entities.”
* The editors flag “Abstract Entities” (1963) as **central to Sellars’s nominalist strategy**: “talk of abstract entities can be explained in terms of talk of linguistic expressions,” using **distributive singular terms** and **dot quotes** to talk about linguistic roles/types rather than spooky Platonic items.

### 1. The headline thesis: “abstract entities” as linguistic expressions (but in a *rarified* sense)

Sellars’s own opening proposal is blunt: he aims to show that **abstract entities are linguistic expressions**, “in an extremely general sense” of “linguistic expression”—and crucially, **not** the ordinary sense in which an expression is a concrete inscription/sound, nor anything as “Platonic” as a timeless universal.

So the guiding idea is a *reversal of metaphysical priority*:

> instead of **language latching onto abstracta**, abstract-entity talk gets reconstructed as **metalinguistic talk about roles, offices, and rule-governed functioning**.

---

## 2. Core technical toolkit (you’ll see these everywhere in the essay)

### A. “Material mode” vs “formal mode”

* Sellars regularly treats apparently ontological claims (“X is an entity,” “Triangularity is a property,” etc.) as **material-mode disguises** for claims in the **formal mode**—claims about *expressions, their categories, and their roles*.
* A key passage later makes this explicit: it “points toward an interpretation of ‘entity’ … as the **material mode** for ‘linguistic expression’,” with “abstract/non-abstract” tracking (roughly) a difference among kinds of linguistic expression.

### B. Distributive singular terms (DSTs): “the K” that isn’t a definite description

Sellars isolates a use of phrases like “the lion” where you’re not talking about a particular lion but are saying something like “lions (as such) are tawny.” He calls these **distributive singulars** / **DSTs**.

Key pieces:

* The “agenda” section stresses the distinctive feature: what’s said of “the lion” can also be said of “lions,” and this can be understood **without** treating “the lion” as a universal of which lions are instances.
* He gives an explicit **equivalence schema** (identity of sense):
  **The K is f** ↔ **All Ks are †f**, where the dagger marks that the RHS is a “non-accidental” truth (connected to criteria/implications for being a K).
* He immediately warns: the logic needs care (e.g., don’t confuse “Not (the K is f)” with “The K is not-f”).

**Why DSTs matter for abstract entities:**
They let Sellars talk about *a “one” over against “many”* (the lion vs lions) without reifying a universal. He explicitly frames this as a way to construe certain “ones vs manys” talk without slipping into Platonism about universals and instances.

### C. Dot quotes: naming a *role/type*, not a sign-design

Dot quotes are Sellars’s engineered device for talking about **linguistic role/office** in a way that:

* isn’t tied to the *particular* English sign design,
* but still lets you *identify* the role by “illustrating” it.

Key points:

* Dot-quote expressions are used “to refer to linguistic types” that are **identifiable** via the naming practice, but **do not have the being of these designs among their criteria**—so a •triangular• doesn’t have to be the inscription “triangular”; it can be German *dreieckig*.
* Dot quotation is explained by analogy to ordinary quotation but with the **descriptive** component reduced and the **prescriptive** component made maximally generic (this is where “role/office” comes to the fore).
* Sellars assigns dot quotes a specific job: they form an expression that must be preceded by “the” to yield a singular term—precisely because these “the •…•” expressions are his **rational reconstructions of abstract singular terms**.

Canonical reconstructions he proposes (first approximation):

* **Triangularity = the •triangular•**
* **That it is raining = the •it is raining•**

---

## 3. The argument’s first big movement: “ones and manys” without universals

### A. A generic vs narrower notion of “abstract entity”

Sellars sketches a distinction:

* A **generic** sense of “abstract entity” where items like “the lion,” “the pawn,” and also dot-quoted items like •triangular• and •two plus two equals four• count as abstract entities **as ones over against manys** (including “linguistic manys”).
* A **narrower** sense where “qualities, relations, sorts, classes, propositions…” are abstract entities, but where (importantly) only some of these are “ones over against instances/members” in the familiar universal-instance way.

This sets up a theme you should keep repeating to yourself while reading:
**“one vs many” is not automatically “universal vs instances.”**

### B. DSTs as a controlled “one”

Sellars argues you can “reduce” certain “ones” to “manys” at the level of sense:

* “the lion” → “lions” (via the DST equivalence), etc.

But (again) you must not confuse this with reducing properties/kinds/classes to instances/members. The reduction is about **linguistic role and sense**, not a metaphysical story about what kinds “really are.”

---

## 4. “Kinds,” “lionkind,” and a controlled ambiguity that explains philosophical confusion

A striking section turns on the observation that “kind” can shift sense depending on whether we’re talking about:

* a **common noun** (formal-mode counterpart),
* or a **DST** (“the lion” as a whole, mentioned).

Sellars’s point: if we say something like “the lion is a kind,” then for it to make sense, “kind” would have to mean something like **distributive individual** (i.e., DST-ish), not “common noun.”

He then links this to classic confusions:

* Russell’s distinction between classes-as-ones vs classes-as-manys,
* and (Frege-style) “kinds” as **distributive objects** in some contexts vs **concepts/functions** in others.

He also suggests using suffixes like “-kind” (“Lionkind”) to form abstract singular terms from common nouns—so that sentences like “Lionkind is a kind (sort)” come out true under the proposed usage, and can be given a systematic reconstruction in terms of dot-quoted items and DSTs.

**Why this matters:**
Sellars is showing you how philosophers get “ontologically excited” by grammatical appearances—because English lets you slide between:

* *using* “the” in ordinary descriptions,
* *using* it distributively (DST),
* and *mentioning* the whole expression (“‘the lion’ is…”).

That slide produces “pseudo-entities” if you don’t keep track of level and role.

---

## 5. Dot quotes in action: translation and cross-language “sameness of role”

Sellars uses a translation case to motivate dot quotes:

* “ ‘dreieckig’ (in German) means triangular” should not be construed as:

  * saying *dreieckig*s are “triangular”s (too tied to an English design), nor
  * equating it with “stands for what *triangular*s stand for (i.e., triangularity)” (which reifies “triangularity” as a thing stood for).

Instead, he proposes capturing “identity of role” with a schema like:

* *dreieckig*s (in German) **are what** *triangular*s **are** in our language,
  and he suggests explicitly quantifying over a “role common noun variable” (R) to make this precise.

Then dot quotes become the way to *name the role itself*:

* a •triangular• can be realized by English *triangular* or German *dreieckig*, because the criteria for being a •triangular• are role/office criteria, not inscription-shape criteria.

---

## 6. Reconstructing “triangularity”: predicates, propositional functions, and a deeper metalinguistics

### A. The “Jumblese/PMese” pressure: what if a language lacks *predicates*?

Sellars imagines a language (Jumblese) that may not have a design playing the role of our predicate *triangular*, but does have items playing the role of *triangular(x)*—i.e., propositional-function-like items. So one must ask:

* Is “triangularity” the type realized by our predicate-designs *triangular*s?
  If so, Jumblese can’t “express triangularity.”
* Or is it the type realized by certain **sentential designs** with *triangular* as a distinctive component?
  Then Jumblese might express triangularity even without predicate-designs like ours.

This leads to a tempting suggestion:

* **Triangularity = the •x is triangular•**

…but Sellars says it “won’t do as it stands,” because it mishandles the role of the variable and what “something” is doing in statements like “That something is triangular entails that it is trilateral.”

### B. “That something is triangular entails that it is trilateral”: why “something” isn’t (∃x)

Sellars insists it would be a mistake to symbolize the material-mode claim as an existential claim (∃x). The “something” is doing a different job: it’s helping form a **metalinguistic common noun** that can apply across different instances (a is triangular, b is triangular, …).

To do this, he argues, you can’t rely purely on “illustrating sign design” constructions (like •a is triangular•), because you need something that ranges across different individual constants. He sketches a move to **non-illustrating common nouns** (PRECON/INDCON families) to model this generality.

(Reading tip: this is one of the densest parts of the essay. It’s where Sellars is trying to show that “triangularity talk” can be reconstructed as *structured metalinguistic talk about permissible inferential transitions*, without any “entity” beyond roles/types.)

---

## 7. Necessary connections among universals = normative constraints on token-sequencing

One of the most philosophically important payoffs: Sellars reconstruing “necessary connections” in terms of **rules/norms of inference**.

He considers:

* “That a is triangular implies that it is trilateral.”

He says the natural reconstruction might look like:

* “The •triangular(a)• implies the •trilateral(a)•,”

…but then warns: it’s *not* saying that wherever a •triangular(a)• occurs, a •trilateral(a)• also occurs (that’d be false). Rather, it tells you what is **correct/proper**: it is correct to place a •trilateral(a)• in sequence after a •triangular(a)• (derivation/proof-theory flavor).

He then extends this to:

* “Triangularity implies trilaterality,”

and criticizes reconstructions that treat it as merely:

* a universal generalization plus a psychological “dispositions to believe” gloss, or
* “‘(x)(triangular → trilateral)’ is analytic” (unless “analytic” is abused to mean “unconditionally assertable”).

The “right” reconstruction, for Sellars, makes explicit the **normative** character via the INDCON machinery (a general implication whose illustrating instances are the familiar a/b/c cases).

**Big lesson:** “necessity” here is not a metaphysical tie between Platonic universals; it’s a **rule-governed inferential constraint** within a language game (continuous with Part I themes about rules, entry/exit transitions, and material inference).

---

## 8. “Abstract entity” talk as metalinguistic talk (late-essay consolidation)

Sellars sets up a puzzle: if many different things (“the lion,” “lionkind,” “triangularity,” etc.) are called “abstract entities,” what’s the **formal-mode** counterpart?

* He says it won’t do to answer simply “linguistic expression,” because although “The •Socrates• is a linguistic expression” is true, “Socrates is an abstract entity” is not. So something more selective is going on—“abstract entity” is tracking a particular **kind** of linguistic expression. He then suggests this supports treating “entity” (in general) as material-mode for “linguistic expression,” and “abstract vs non-abstract entity” as reflecting a dichotomy among expressions.

He also notes the system has “free play” for **wider vs narrower** senses of “abstract entity,” and introduces an explication schema involving metalinguistic DSTs (important for tracking which “ones” are reconstructed as DST-like).

### A quick cautionary payoff: “Sokrates expresses Socrateity” vs “Sokrates names Socrates”

Sellars warns not to confuse:

* “ ‘Sokrates’ (in German) expresses (the sense) Socrateity”
  with:
* “ ‘Sokrates’ (in German) names Socrates.”

The first (sense/role claim) could be true even if no such person existed—again: **semantic role ≠ reference to an entity**.

---

## 9. “What to keep straight” checklist (so the essay doesn’t blur)

When you’re reading, constantly ask which side you’re on:

1. **Object-language vs metalanguage**
   Am I talking about lions—or about the expression “lion,” or about the expression-role •lion•?

2. **Sign design vs role/type**

   * *triangular* (a particular inscription/sound-design)
   * •triangular• (the role/office/type that can be realized by *triangular* or *dreieckig*)

3. **Use vs mention** (especially around “the” and “the lion”)
   Some of Sellars’s “kinds” talk pivots on whether you’re using “the” or mentioning “‘the lion’ ” as an expression-form.

4. **Distributive “one over many” vs universal-instance metaphysics**
   DST “the K” is a “one” over “many Ks,” but that’s not yet “universal of which they’re instances.”

5. **Descriptive vs prescriptive criteria**
   Dot quotes are engineered to foreground “office/role” (the norm-governed side), not pictorial similarity of inscriptions.

---

# Part II synthesis page: how Essays 5–7 lock together

### The shared problem (Part II’s target)

Part II targets a familiar philosophical temptation:

> Because English has singular terms like “triangularity,” we get pulled toward thinking there *must be* a thing—an abstract entity—that the term names.

Sellars’s Part II strategy is to show that this is (often) a **grammatical projection**: what looks like ontology is really (or can be reconstructed as) **metalinguistics**.

---

## Essay 5 (“Naming and Saying”): make the “role vs object” distinction unavoidable

What it contributes (high-level):

* Builds (via Wittgenstein/Tractatus and the constructed language **Jumblese**) a setting where you can see how wildly grammar can mislead you about “what there is.”
* The editors emphasize that Jumblese is designed to be “ideally perspicuous” about the different roles of **singular terms, predicates, and sentences**, precisely to avoid deep philosophical confusion.

**Role in the arc:** it loosens the grip of surface grammar and primes you to accept that “predicate-like talk” might be reconstrued without reifying universals.

---

## Essay 6 (“Grammar and Existence”): stop the Quinean slide from quantifying to “there being”

What it contributes (high-level):

* It targets the move from “we can quantify in certain ways” to “we are ontologically committed to abstract entities.”
* The editors say Sellars names his general approach here **“syntactical therapy”**: abstract singular terms show up in “quasi-syntactical statements in the material mode,” where what *seem* like ontological categories are better understood as *syntactical* categories (e.g., “triangularity is a property” functioning as a covert claim about “triangular” being an adjective).

**Role in the arc:** it gives the *methodological license* for the core Part II maneuver: don’t read metaphysics off grammar + quantifiers.

---

## Essay 7 (“Abstract Entities”): provide the full reconstruction machinery

What it contributes (now in detail):

* It gives the actual “nuts and bolts” that make syntactical therapy work:

  * **DSTs** for “one vs many” without universals
  * **dot quotes** for role/type talk untied to particular sign-designs
  * a **normative** account of “necessary connections” as correct token-sequencing/inferential propriety

**Role in the arc:** it turns the Part II project from a warning (“don’t reify”) into a *system* (“here is how to speak carefully instead”).

---

## The three-essay “one continuous argument” (a clean chain)

Here’s a compact chain you can keep in mind while reading Part II:

1. **(Essay 5)** Grammar can make us confuse roles (what expressions do) with objects (what expressions name). So we need perspicuous tools (Jumblese) to prevent that confusion.
2. **(Essay 6)** Even sophisticated logical resources (quantification, higher-order talk) don’t automatically settle ontology. Many “ontological” claims are better treated as **quasi-syntactical** material-mode statements—this is “syntactical therapy.”
3. **(Essay 7)** To actually *do* the therapy, we need a workable metalanguage:

   * DSTs explain how “the K” talk can be “one over many” without universals
   * dot quotes let us talk about *roles/types* rather than inscriptions
   * and “necessary connections” become inferential/normative constraints rather than metaphysical glue between universals

**Result:** Part II reads as a sustained attempt to replace a metaphysical picture (**abstracta as entities “out there”**) with a metalinguistic one (**abstracta-talk as talk about rule-governed roles in a language game**).

---

## Mini self-test questions (to check you’ve got Part II as a whole)

1. What *exactly* is the difference between *triangular* and •triangular• in Sellars’s usage? (What changes when you move from sign-design to role/type?)
2. Why does the DST equivalence (“The K is f” ↔ “All Ks are †f”) help you avoid treating “the K” as a universal?
3. In Sellars’s reconstruction, what kind of claim is “Triangularity implies trilaterality”—a descriptive generalization, a semantic truth (“analytic”), or a normative constraint on inference? Why?

---

If you want, next we can start **Part III** in the same “2 essays at a time” rhythm (Essays 8 & 9), or we can do a **short bridge page** explaining how Part II’s nominalism about abstracta sets up the Part III moves about mind and world (especially how dot quotes and “roles” reappear in Sellars’s account of mental episodes).
