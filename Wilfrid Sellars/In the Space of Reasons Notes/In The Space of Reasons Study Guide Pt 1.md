According to a document from **2007**, **Part I: “Language and Meaning”** in *In the Space of Reasons* contains four essays: **(1) “Inference and Meaning,” (2) “Some Reflections on Language Games,” (3) “Language as Thought and as Communication,”** and **(4) “Meaning as Functional Classification: A Perspective on the Relation of Syntax to Semantics.”**

Below are structured, study-oriented notes for the whole Part I (plus a “glossary” and discussion questions). My aim is to make it easy to: (i) see what each essay is *doing*, (ii) track recurring machinery (rules, inference, norms, “meaning” talk), and (iii) connect the essays into one cumulative view.

---

## Part I at a glance: the through-line

Part I develops a distinctive Sellarsian strategy: **explain meaning and conceptual content by the role expressions play inside rule-governed practices—especially inferential practices—rather than by positing “meaning relations” between words and extra-linguistic items.** That “role” is articulated by what people are *entitled/required/permitted* to do with expressions (infer with them, respond with them, act on them), i.e. by norms.

Two slogans to keep in mind as you read:

* **Conceptual content is articulated by inferential roles** (including “material” inferential roles). Sellars ends “Inference and Meaning” by saying that *material transformation rules determine the descriptive meaning of expressions (within a framework of logical rules).*
* **Modal vocabulary and normative vocabulary are intimately linked**: in “Inference and Meaning” he develops a Carnap-inspired account on which the language of “logical necessity” is understood via rules that say what one *may* or *ought* to do with expressions—so that modal talk is a “transposed” normative talk.

---

## Essay 1 — “Inference and Meaning” (1953)

### 1) The central problem

Sellars is worried about the status of **“material” rules of inference**—inferences whose goodness depends on *which* non-logical terms occur, not merely on logical form (e.g., “It’s lightning, so there will be thunder,” “It’s raining, so the streets will be wet,” etc.). The question is: are these genuine inferences? If so, what authority do they have, and how do they relate to meaning?

He sets up the landscape by distinguishing **six positions** about material inference (ranging from “material rules are essential to meaning” all the way to “they aren’t inferences at all—just association dressed up with ‘therefore’”).

### 2) Carnap’s tool: L-rules vs P-rules (formal vs material)

Sellars uses Carnap’s *Logical Syntax of Language* distinction to clarify the formal/material split.

* **Logical (L-) valid inferences** are valid purely by form; descriptive terms occur “vacuously.”
* **Extra-logical (P-) valid inferences** depend on descriptive vocabulary; descriptive terms occur “essentially.”
* Carnap calls the corresponding rules **L-rules** vs **P-rules**, and Sellars walks through the idea that P-rules would authorize inferences that would otherwise require a lawlike premise to be logically valid.

This is not just taxonomy: it’s meant to make vivid that *there’s something to be explained* about material inference—either it’s eliminable (enthymeme story), or it’s a distinctive kind of rule-governed move.

### 3) Why material rules matter: subjunctive conditionals

A major argumentative engine is the connection between **material rules** and **subjunctive conditionals**. Sellars considers “Metaphysicus” (a kind of rationalist foil) arguing that subjunctive conditionals like “If there were lightning, there would be thunder” express **material rules of inference** (not mere formal ones).

The upshot you’re meant to feel: **subjunctive conditionals are pervasive in science and ordinary reasoning; if they presuppose material rules, then material rules are not optional “conveniences.”** (Even if you *can* restate some things in a purely formal way by adding explicit law premises, that may miss what’s going on in ordinary rule-governed competence.)

### 4) Modal vocabulary as “transposed” norms

Sellars builds a refined Carnap-style reading of modal sentences. Carnap’s starting point: modal sentences in the material mode (“It is logically necessary that…”) correspond to quasi-syntactical claims about derivability. Sellars then stresses that derivability is not just a structural relation between inscriptions; it’s tied to **permission/obligation** governing moves with expressions.

In a key passage he says Carnap’s analysis becomes the claim that talk of “logical necessity” **conveys the same information as syntactical rules** about what we may/ought not do in manipulating expressions; hence **“the language of modalities is interpreted as a ‘transposed’ language of norms.”**

He then refines “conveys” by distinguishing:

* **asserts** (about the world: e.g., “The sky is clear” asserts meteorological info),
* **conveys** (about the speaker’s state/role in a rule-governed practice).

### 5) Against “semantical rules” (in the crude sense)

Sellars takes aim at a tempting picture: meaning comes from two kinds of rules—
(a) syntactical rules (symbol–symbol),
(b) semantical rules whereby “basic descriptive terms acquire extra-linguistic meaning.”

He argues this is a “radical mistake.” The key thought: **obeying a rule requires recognizing the circumstances the rule applies to.** If a “semantical rule” is supposed to *give* the meaning of “red” by saying something like “red objects are to be responded to by the noise ‘red’,” then recognizing when that rule applies already requires the concept red—so you’ve presupposed what you claimed to explain.

This is one way Sellars undermines “meaning-by-ostension/response” pictures: he’s not denying training and reinforcement; he’s denying that they can *by themselves* be the whole story about conceptual content.

### 6) The conclusion: meaning is inferential-role within a rule system

At the end he draws a strong conclusion: if P-rules are indispensable for descriptive language, and “semantic rule” stories don’t work, then we are pushed toward the view that **material transformation rules determine descriptive meaning (within the logical framework).**

### 7) One more (important) meta-point: conceptual frames and “pragmatic a priori”

Late in the essay Sellars explicitly rejects “intuitable hallmarks” of the One True conceptual scheme: there are indefinitely many possible conceptual structures/languages; they “compete in the marketplace of practice,” and this yields (with C. I. Lewis) a **“pragmatic conception of the a priori.”**

That matters because it frames the rest of Part I: language-games, meaning-statements, and semantic vocabulary are tools within revisable practices—not mirrors of a pre-given ontology.

### Discussion checks for Essay 1

1. Why does Sellars think subjunctive conditionals force the issue about material rules?
2. What exactly is the circularity problem for “semantic rules” (as rules for applying basic predicates)?
3. What does the “modal talk = transposed norms” idea buy him—and what might it leave out?

---

## Essay 2 — “Some Reflections on Language Games” (1954)

### 1) The regress problem: “learning language = learning rules” looks self-defeating

Sellars begins with a plausible thesis: a language is a system of expressions governed by rules; learning a language is learning to obey rules. But he says the thesis, “taken as it stands,” faces an “obvious and devastating refutation” (a regress): learning the rules would require already understanding the language the rules are stated in.

So the constructive task is: **restate the rule-following view in a way that makes first-language learning intelligible.**

### 2) The key move: distinguish “pattern-governed” from “rule-obeying”

Sellars’s solution hinges on separating:

* behavior that merely **conforms** to a pattern (learned, trained, reinforced), from
* behavior that **obeys** a rule (involves grasping/endorsing a norm).

He introduces (and later develops) the notion of **pattern-governed behavior** as intermediate between brute regularity and explicit rule-obedience.

The point is *not* to make language non-normative; it’s to show how normativity can be learned without the impossible requirement that the learner already has explicit rule formulations.

### 3) Language games: positions, moves, and three “transitions”

Sellars offers a “language game” model in which:

* **positions** in a language game can be thought of as judgments/claims one occupies,
* **moves** are inferences from one position to another.

He explicitly says: *to occupy a position in a language game is to think/judge/assert; to make a move is to infer.*

And, crucially, the “language game” needs not only intra-linguistic transitions, but also:

* **language-entry transitions** (from the world/perception into linguistic positions),
* **language-departure/exit transitions** (from linguistic positions to action).

This triad becomes a backbone of Sellars’s later “functional role” semantics.

### 4) What are “meaning statements” doing?

A highlight of this essay is its deflationary account of semantical discourse.

Sellars imagines telling an English speaker what “rot” means in German. The tempting thought: you are *describing a relation* between “rot” and redness. Sellars: no—what you’re doing is giving the learner practical guidance on how to *play the German game* with “rot.”

He says semantical statements of the form “‘rot’ means red” are not descriptions of a word–world relation; rather, they are a “device” that helps “bring home” to the learner how Germans use the word, and they “convey no information” beyond what is already given in a description of the language game’s pieces and transitions.

In another passage he makes the meta-point explicit: semantical discourse of the form “S in L means p” should not be understood as *asserting* something in the way object-language descriptions do; it functions in a practice of teaching/using language and (in that sense) “conveys” rather than straightforwardly asserts.

### 5) “No problem of induction” in the usual sense

Sellars frames an anti-Humean thought: once you understand that a language game includes *material* inference moves, the so-called “problem of induction” is reconfigured. The “leap” is not from observed facts to unobserved facts *outside* language; it’s about **what material moves belong in the game.** He says “the problem of induction is not a problem,” and that the question is “rather the question: What material moves should be included in the set of moves of the language game?”

He also insists: **there are no “premises” for “material moves” in the way there are for logical derivations**—to look for such premises is to misunderstand what material rules are.

### 6) “No premises outside all language games”

An especially important Sellarsian line: if reasons are always “within” a framework, then the skeptical demand for a “premise outside the whole game” is misguided. He says there can be “no premises” for reasons that are “outside all language games,” and that (even when we talk about “the given”) we are not talking about a “premise.”

This is one of Part I’s bridges to Sellars’s broader attack on “the Myth of the Given.”

### 7) Observation judgments are not conclusions

Later in the essay he emphasizes: you can *conclude* that some episode was an observation judgment, but observation judgments themselves are not “conclusions.”

Relatedly, he denies a crude “positivist” contrast where only observational vocabulary has conceptual meaning and theoretical vocabulary is merely “methodological constructs.” He says the conceptual status of **theoretical** terms is no more merely methodological than that of “non-theoretical” terms like “red.”

### Discussion checks for Essay 2

1. What exactly is the regress, and how does “pattern-governed” behavior help?
2. Why are meaning statements not (primarily) descriptive, on Sellars’s view?
3. How does the “no premises outside all language games” claim reshape traditional empiricism/skepticism debates?

---

## Essay 3 — “Language as Thought and as Communication” (1969)

This essay is where Sellars explicitly welds together: (i) language games and rules, (ii) the idea that language is the medium of thought, and (iii) a story about how “inner thought” relates to “outer speech.”

### 1) Rules, norms, and “ought”-vocabulary

Sellars treats rules as fundamentally tied to “ought.” He says there are sentences in any language whose use makes essential reference to the force of “ought,” and that these are the “strongest and most explicit expression” of rules and ruling.

He then introduces a key distinction:

* **“ought-to-be”** statements (rules of criticism: how linguistic behavior *ought* to go),
* **“ought-to-do”** statements (rules of action: what one *ought to do*).

This distinction becomes crucial for understanding language learning and the structure of linguistic normativity.

### 2) Not everything linguistic is “rule-obeying”

Sellars insists that we must not equate being rule-governed with always explicitly obeying rules. He claims there are “types of pattern-governed linguistic behavior which never become obeyings of the relevant rules of criticism as rules of action,” including (notably) the **language entry** and **language departure** transitions.

And he gives a vivid picture of training:

* trainees **conform** to “linguistic ought-to-be’s” because trainers **obey** “linguistic ought-to-do’s”; over time the trainee comes to follow rules of action (not just criticism).

### 3) Thinking-out-loud and belief

A recurring Sellars move is to take **thinking-out-loud** as basic (at least “in the order of knowing”). The core idea:

* to say someone **believes that-p** is (roughly) to attribute a settled disposition to **think that-p**.

And he stresses a developmental story: a child learns to “think-out-loud” (to produce linguistic episodes with the right functional/inferential role), and later can suppress overt utterance and “think without uttering.”

### 4) Inference vs “reasoning about entitlement”

Sellars draws a subtle distinction that becomes important for “space of reasons” readings. He says inferring that “q” from “p” is one thing; asking *whether one is entitled* to infer it is another. For example: “Jones infers ‘q’ from ‘p’…” differs from “Smith reasons as follows: Jones claims ‘p’; Jones claims ‘p ⊃ q’; so Jones is entitled to infer ‘q’.”

That split helps you see why Sellars can be both:

* **naturalistic** about what people *do* (episodes, dispositions, training), and
* **normative** about what they’re *entitled/committed* to (rules of criticism and action).

### Discussion checks for Essay 3

1. Why does Sellars insist language-entry/exit transitions may never become “rule-obeying” in the explicit sense?
2. How does the “thinking-out-loud” model help avoid a Cartesian “inner episode” picture (without denying inner thought entirely)?
3. What’s the payoff of distinguishing inferring from reasoning about entitlement?

---

## Essay 4 — “Meaning as Functional Classification” (1974)

This essay is the most explicitly “semantic-theoretic” of Part I, and it’s where Sellars develops machinery (dot-quotes, distributive singular terms, “means” as copula) for *saying in the metalanguage what meaning-statements do*—without treating meanings as mysterious entities or meaning as a relation.

### 1) Three “levels” of meaning questions (via Harman)

Sellars starts from Gilbert Harman’s point that philosophers often conflate different projects:

1. language as the **medium of thought**,
2. language as **communication**,
3. language as bound up with **social practices** (promising, warning, etc.).

He agrees these are not competing answers to one question; treating them as such leads to confusion.

### 2) “Saying” vs mere “uttering”: parroting vs thinking-out-loud

Sellars emphasizes the difference between:

* **Jones said** “2 + 2 = 4”
  and
* **Jones uttered** sounds associated with “2 + 2 = 4”.

He anticipates an objection: thinking-out-loud involves knowing meanings; surely that’s not just producing sounds. His reply: the key difference is not a non-linguistic inner act of “knowing meaning,” but that meaningful utterances **cohere with each other and context** in a way parroting doesn’t; “knowing meaning” here is a kind of *knowing how* (Rylean), distinct from lexicographer-style explicit definition.

This ties directly back to Essay 2’s regress worry: mastery is practical competence before it is explicit theorizing.

### 3) Core thesis: meaning statements classify function

Sellars explicitly proposes:

> To say what someone says (or what a kind of utterance says) is to give a **functional classification** of the utterance—using expressions the audience already commands (“background language”).

And he notes that the relevant “functions” include:

* intra-linguistic (syntactic) functions,
* **language-entry** functions (responsive to sensory stimulation),
* and practical (language-to-action) functions.

### 4) Analyzed example: “‘Und’ (in German) means and”

Sellars uses the “old chestnut”:

* (3) “‘Und’ (in German) means and”

He insists you shouldn’t treat the subject “‘Und’” as naming an abstract universal (a word-entity). Instead, it’s more like a general/distributive way of talking about tokens (many “und”s) without reifying a “word-universal.”

He introduces **distributive singular terms (DSTs)** like “the lion” in “The lion is tawny,” which are roughly equivalent to “All lions are tawny.”

On this basis, (3) is (for his purposes) equivalent to “‘und’s (in German) mean and.”

### 5) “Dot quotes” and the non-relational reading of “means”

Sellars’s official analysis is:

* “‘und’s (in German) are •and•s.”

Here “•and•” is an **illustrating functional sortal**: an expression (built with dot quotes) that classifies anything that functions relevantly like “and” does in our background language.

Then comes the crucial metaphysical/semantic punchline:

* **Meaning is not a relation**, because **“means” is a specialized form of the copula** (a way of classifying), not a relation-word standing for some word–meaning relation.

And he adds: instead of “giving” meaning via the illustrating sortal, we could list the governing syntactical rules; meaning statements are practically useful because listing the entire rule-cluster is usually infeasible.

### 6) Extending the strategy: “stands for triangularity” and the “pub” example

Sellars then treats “stands for” similarly. He argues that “triangularity” merely *looks* like a name for an abstract entity; instead it functions as a metalinguistic distributive term, and “stands for” is another specialized copula.

He uses:

* “The pub is the poor man’s club”
  to show that “is” here is not identity but a classificatory copula; it’s roughly equivalent to “Pubs are poor men’s clubs.” He then reads “‘dreieckig’ is the German •triangular•” in the same classificatory way.

### Discussion checks for Essay 4

1. Why does Sellars insist “knowing meaning” is not a separate non-linguistic inner act?
2. What problem is solved by treating “means” as a specialized copula rather than a relation?
3. How do dot quotes help specify functional roles without reifying “meanings”?

---

## How the four essays lock together

Here’s one way to see the architecture of Part I:

1. **Essay 1 (Inference and Meaning)** argues that *material* inferential rules are indispensable and meaning-constitutive; it also ties modality to norms and rejects crude “semantic rule” origin stories.

2. **Essay 2 (Language Games)** provides a model of language as a rule-governed practice that avoids regress by distinguishing pattern-governed competence from explicit rule-obedience, and it gives a pragmatics of meaning-talk as guidance/“bringing home” use rather than describing a relation.

3. **Essay 3 (Language as Thought and Communication)** connects this to the mind: thinking is modeled as (or at least understood via) thinking-out-loud and dispositions; norms are split into criticism vs action; and not all linguistic doings are explicit rule-obedience.

4. **Essay 4 (Meaning as Functional Classification)** gives the metalanguage to talk about meaning without Platonism: meaning statements are functional classifications using dot-quoted role sortals; “means” and “stands for” are specialized copulas; semantics is grounded in the rule-governed roles (entry, exit, inference) described earlier.

---

## Mini-glossary for Part I

* **Formal inference rule / L-rule:** validity depends only on logical form (descriptive terms vacuous).
* **Material inference rule / P-rule:** validity depends on descriptive vocabulary (descriptive terms essential).
* **Pattern-governed behavior:** learned regularities that can be evaluated by norms without requiring explicit rule-grasp at the start; used to block regress in language learning.
* **Rules of criticism (“ought-to-be”) vs rules of action (“ought-to-do”):** two normative layers in language; trainees start with conformity to criticism under trainers’ action-guidance.
* **Language entry / intra-linguistic / language exit transitions:** three sorts of role-defining transitions (world→language; language→language; language→action).
* **“Means” as specialized copula:** meaning statements classify function; they are not relational claims about word–meaning entities.
* **Dot quotes (•…•):** expressive device for “illustrating” functional roles (metalinguistic sortals) rather than naming abstract entities.
* **Distributive singular terms (DSTs):** singular-looking phrases (“the lion”) functioning like generalizations (“All lions…”), used to avoid reifying abstract entities in meaning-talk.

---

## Suggested way to work through Part I (practically)

If you’re reading “part by part,” one productive rhythm is:

1. **After “Inference and Meaning”**: write down 2–3 examples of “material inferences” you actually use (everyday or scientific), then ask: what would it mean to treat them as *rules* rather than as “implicit premises”? Use the subjunctive link as a test case.

2. **After “Language Games”**: try to model a tiny language game (e.g., “red/green” reporting + a simple inference + a simple action). Identify entry, intra-, exit transitions. Then ask: what would a “meaning statement” do in this model (instruction, not relation-description)?

3. **After “Language as Thought…”**: watch for where Sellars switches from *what people do* (episodes/dispositions) to *what they’re entitled to do* (rules/oughts). Track the “inferring vs reasoning about entitlement” distinction explicitly in your notes.

4. **After “Meaning as Functional Classification”**: rewrite a few meaning/translation claims in Sellars’s classificatory style (“‘X’ are •Y•s”) and see what that commits you to (and what it avoids). Use the parroting vs saying discussion as your “sanity check” that meaning is competence, not a ghostly inner act.

---

If you want, for the *next step* we can go even more granular: pick **Essay 1** and I’ll produce a section-by-section walkthrough (with a running “argument map,” key claims in order, and “what to watch for” notes), then do the same for Essays 2–4.

Below are **granular, section-by-section notes** for **Essay 1 (“Inference and Meaning”)** and **Essay 2 (“Some Reflections on Language Games”)** from *In the Space of Reasons*. 

---

## Essay 1 — “Inference and Meaning” (1953)

### What Sellars is trying to do (one sentence)

Show that **material inference rules** are (i) genuine inference, (ii) not merely “shortcuts” for explicit law-premises, (iii) intimately tied to modality/norms, and (iv) **meaning-constitutive**. 

---

### Section I — The target: the “enthymeme” picture + six positions on material inference

**Setup: empiricist dogma (and the Metaphysicus foil).**
Sellars starts from a familiar empiricist move: treat “It is raining, therefore the streets will be wet” as an enthymeme whose missing premise is a universal generalization (“Whenever it rains…”). The retort is: since the expanded argument is formally valid, any “necessity” involved is just logical necessity. Sellars grants this is tempting, but says it **doesn’t settle whether material inference is real.** 

**Why empiricists want to shave material rules away (Ockham).**
He diagnoses a tacit Razor argument: even if “material principles” made sense, logic + explicit generalizations would *do the same work*, so why posit them? 

**Harder move: deny material inference is inference (Humean “habit”).**
Sellars reconstructs an even more drastic line: if the “raining→wet streets” transition isn’t an enthymeme, it’s just a learned expectation—“a habitual transition of the imagination”—so not assessable as valid/invalid by rules. He pushes back: you can’t demote “causal inference” to mere habit unless you also explain what makes **logical** inference more than habit. 

**Six conceptions of material rules.**
He then lays out **six** possible standings for material rules—ranging from “meaning-constitutive” to “not inference at all.” This is your master “option-space” for the whole essay. 

> **Reading tip:** keep track of which options are being eliminated as the essay proceeds. The endgame is to push you toward option (1): material rules help *constitute meaning*.

---

### Section II — Carnap’s machinery: L-rules vs P-rules (formal vs material)

**Transformation rules + “content.”**
Sellars turns to Carnap’s *Logical Syntax*: rules of inference are “transformation rules.” Logical symbols have the feature that sentences built solely from them are determinate; and Carnap distinguishes “logical” vs “extra-logical” rules. 

**Quine’s helpful gloss: vacuous vs essential descriptive terms.**
In **logically valid** inferences, descriptive terms occur “vacuously”; in **extra-logically valid** inferences, they occur “essentially.” 

**P-rules as “lawlike” inference-licensers.**
Carnap’s P-rules authorize inferences that would otherwise require a law as an explicit premise; Sellars illustrates with L-valid vs P-valid inference patterns. 

**Carnap’s dispensability thesis (and the question it raises).**
Carnap thinks you can always build a language with only L-rules that can “say everything” a P-rule language can—suggesting P-rules are optional conveniences. Sellars flags this as a live issue: *optional? derivative?* 

> **Sellars’s pivot:** even if you *can* simulate P-rule reasoning with explicit premises, that doesn’t show P-rules are philosophically idle.

---

### Section III — Subjunctive conditionals: the “function” that seems to require material rules

**Metaphysicus’s key claim:** subjunctives *express* inference rules.
Sellars has “Metaphysicus” argue: a subjunctive like “If there were lightning, there would be thunder” gives voice to a material rule (roughly: thunder may be inferred from lightning), not to a purely logical rule. 

**Testing the enthymeme strategy against subjunctives.**
Empiricists try the same move: make the content “fully explicit” by adding universal premises. Sellars shows the cheap “since… if…” expansion collapses the subjunctive force into a mere material implication (“it will rain ⊃ wet streets”), losing what we needed (the inferential/necessitating bite). 

**Crucial upshot (provisional):** authority not derivative from formal rules.
If you can’t recover the subjunctive’s force without reintroducing a material rule (e.g., entailment/necessitation), then material rules aren’t merely “derived” from logic + premises. 

**But note the subtlety:** “dispensable” doesn’t imply “no P-rules.”
Sellars allows: maybe some languages avoid subjunctives (Carnap’s extensional calculi), but then the *same function* must be done elsewhere—e.g., by stating material rules explicitly in a metalanguage. 

---

### Section IV — What *is* a rule of inference? From “structural relation” to “conditional assertibility”

**Core critique of Carnap:** rules aren’t just structural facts.
Sellars says Carnap’s habit of defining “derivable”/“consequence” in purely structural terms forgets that rules are inherently **rulish**—they have “ought/may” force. 

**Rules govern *doings*—here, asserting.**
A rule of derivability is (roughly): it’s permissible to assert B given A, and impermissible to assert not-B given A—i.e. a **rule of conditional assertion** (not a rule for asserting a conditional). 

**Primitive sentences = unconditional assertibility.**
He contrasts conditional-assertion rules with rules that authorize some sentences without appeal to evidence/grounds (“primitive sentences”); and notes that unconditional assertibility entails that the contradictory ought not be asserted. 

> **Why this matters for meaning:** it relocates “logical structure” from an abstract relation among inscriptions to a norm-governed practice of asserting.

---

### Section V — Modality: “a transposed language of norms” + asserts vs conveys

**Modal statements as quasi-syntactical talk about rules.**
Sellars endorses a Carnap-style move: “If a is red & square, it is logically necessary that a is red” conveys what’s captured by L-derivability claims; but he insists we must treat derivability itself as normative/permissive. 

**Slogan:** modal talk = “transposed” norms-talk.
He explicitly says Carnap’s analysis becomes: modal sentences “convey the same information” as rules about what we may/ought not do with expressions—so modal vocabulary is a “transposed language of norms.” 

**Key refinement:** distinguish what a sentence *asserts* vs what it *conveys*.
Sellars distinguishes (i) asserting meteorological content vs (ii) conveying information about the speaker’s state/stance. For “ϕ necessitates ψ,” he says it **conveys** (not asserts) that the speaker conforms to an L-derivability rule. 

**Anti-reductionism:** modal / normative / psychological are mutually irreducible.
Even though “necessary” talk and “ought” talk overlap psychologically, neither denotes a psychological property; and he warns against the idea that necessities are “created by rules.” 

---

### Section VI — Meaning: from “semantic rules” to inferential role + pragmatic a priori

**Semantical statements are not word–world relation reports.**
Sellars argues that statements like “‘rot’ means red” *look* like empirical relation claims, but actually **convey** information about use; they’re akin (in status) to the “must” of modal talk. 

**Against “semantical rules” as meaning-makers.**
The tempting picture: two rule types—syntactical rules (symbol–symbol) and “semantical rules” that attach basic predicates to extra-linguistic meanings. Sellars calls this radically mistaken because **obeying a rule requires recognizing its application circumstances**; a “red objects → say ‘red’” rule already presupposes the concept *red*. 

**Differentiate rule-governed vs associative uniformities.**
A uniformity is rule-governed not merely as uniformity, but as occurring “because of” a norm; this distinction is blurred by sloppy talk of “ostensive definition.” 

**The punchline:** material rules determine descriptive meaning.
Having argued (i) P-rules’ role (esp. via subjunctives), (ii) rules’ normative nature, and (iii) the failure of “semantical rule” stories, Sellars concludes that **material transformation rules determine descriptive meaning within the logical framework.** 

**Meta-level: pragmatic a priori.**
He ends by rejecting a single “royal” conceptual scheme: there are many possible rule-systems/languages competing in practice—yielding a “pragmatic conception of the a priori.” 

---

### Essay 1 — “Carry-forward” checklist

When you move to Essay 2, keep these four anchors from Essay 1 in mind:

1. **Material inference is real** (not just shorthand). 
2. **Rules are normative** (about permissible/impermissible asserting). 
3. **Modal talk is a way of “showing” rule-governed stance.** 
4. **Meaning isn’t grounded in “semantic rules” or word–world relations**, but in rule-governed roles (especially inferential roles). 

---

## Essay 2 — “Some Reflections on Language Games” (1954)

### What Sellars is trying to do (one sentence)

Defend “language = rule-governed practice” **without** making first-language learning impossible, by introducing **pattern-governed behavior** and a **language-game** model (entry/inference/exit transitions). 

---

### §§1–2 — The regress argument against “learning a language = learning rules”

Sellars states the attractive thesis (“learning L = learning to obey rules of L”), then gives the “devastating” refutation: rules are stated in a metalanguage; learning them presupposes knowing ML; ML presupposes MML; etc.—a vicious regress. 

---

### §§3–6 — The too-easy repair: “conforming” vs “obeying”

He considers replacing “obey” with “conform”: to conform to a rule is just to do A in C (regardless of whether the agent has the rule “in mind”). This blocks the regress *formally*, but it feels like cheating—does it leave out what makes something a “move in the game”? 

---

### §§7–12 — Metaphysicus’s attempt: rules as “entities” graspable without language

**The proposal:** distinguish the rule sentence (“Do A in C!” in different languages) from “the rule itself” (the meaning expressed), so one can be aware of rules before one can verbalize them. 

**Why it fails:** “awareness” threatens to reintroduce the regress.
If “becoming aware of demands/permissions” is itself a kind of game-move, you’re back in the metagame. Sellars says: to make Metaphysicus work, “awareness” can’t be game-playing—but reasoning/awareness looks game-like (we evaluate it as correct/mistaken). 

---

### §§12–18 — The real escape hatch: reject a false dichotomy; introduce *pattern-governed* behavior

Sellars diagnoses the hidden assumption: either (a) mere accidental conformity, or (b) explicit obeying “with the rule in mind.” He calls that a **false dichotomy**—a system can be explanatorily operative without being explicitly envisaged. 

He uses evolution/bee-dance analogies to show how a pattern can be “because of” a system without intention to realize it. 

**Key distinction:** pattern-governed vs rule-obeying.
Learning a language can be coming to do A in C “because of a system of moves” without intending to realize a rule system. Rule-obeying behavior is a more complex phenomenon that includes a metagame. 

---

### §§19–27 — Building the language-game model: positions, moves, entry, exit, auxiliaries, modality

**Positions and moves (the core metaphor).**

* Occupying a position in a language is thinking/judging/asserting.
* Making a move is inferring. 

**Not all positions come from other positions (observation).**
Observation sentences are “positions” you can occupy without inferring to them—yet unlike chess’s initial position, language specifies how they’re “set up” (via perception). 

**Crucial trio:** inference vs entry vs departure.
Sellars defines:

* **Moves:** transitions where both stimulus and response are positions (inference).
* **Language-entry transitions:** non-position → position (perceptual uptake), where the stimulus can be said to be “meant by” the response.
* **Language-departure transitions:** position → non-position (action), where the non-linguistic response can be “meant by” the linguistic position. 

**Auxiliary/free positions.**
He adds a third route to occupying a position: “free”/auxiliary positions (primitive sentences, unconditionally assertable) that are catalytic. 

**Modal talk as signaling moves/auxiliaries.**
He suggests modal vocabulary can develop as a way to “signalize” the status of certain auxiliary positions/moves; and its full flavor connects to metalanguage rule-words like “may/ought/permitted.” 

---

### §§28–29 — Formal vs material moves; laws of nature

He explicitly reintroduces the formal/material distinction at the level of moves and primitive sentences and connects “lawlikeness” to the **material moves** a language includes. 

---

### §§30–35 — Meaning-talk + the pragmatist worry

**Meaning statements don’t add “semantic relations.”**
Sellars argues that “‘rot’ means red” is a device for “bringing home” how Germans use “rot”; it conveys no information beyond what could be stated in terms of pieces/positions/moves/entry/exit transitions of the language game. 

**Pragmatist challenge (and Sellars’s partial concession).**
Pragmatism is right to stress language as an instrument in coping with the world, but it’s a category mistake to *define* “means” or “true” in purely instrumental/problem-solving terms. 

---

### §§35–37 — Why practical vocabulary is not optional

Sellars argues: merely having descriptive/material inferences doesn’t make language action-guiding; for action-guidance you need a sublanguage of action-terms and transitions from descriptive conclusions to practical commitments (e.g., from “yonder is fire” to “going yonder is going to fire”). 

---

### §§38–49 — Rule-obeying behavior and metalanguages (how “rules” re-enter without regress)

He returns to rule-obeying behavior as involving a **game + metagame**, and stresses you need not first master a game as mere pattern-governed behavior in order to learn it as rule-obeying (e.g., you can learn chess once you have enough background discriminations). 

---

### §§50–56 — Imperatives, normatives, and universality

Sellars treats normatives as action-enjoining positions with a special logical property: **singular normatives are “implicitly universal.”** 

---

### §§57–72 — Induction, reasons, and conceptual frameworks

**No “problem of induction” in the classic sense.**
A language with no material moves is “chimerical”; the “inductive leap from a pure observation base” is an absurdity. The real question is: **which** material moves to include. 

**Reasons are always within a framework.**
He insists you can’t justify a language game from “premises outside all language games,” and famously adds: you can conclude that x was an observation judgment, but **observation judgments are not conclusions.** 

---

## How Essays 1 and 2 interlock (what to watch as you read)

* Essay 1 argues that **material inference is meaning-relevant** and that rules are fundamentally **normative** (conditional assertibility, permissions). 
* Essay 2 gives you the **practice-psychology** that makes that picture livable: language users can be governed by norms without explicit rule-formulations, via **pattern-governed behavior**, and language is structured by **entry / intra-linguistic / exit** transitions.

If you want, next we can do a “close-reading pass” where I extract **(a)** the 5–8 most load-bearing claims in each essay, **(b)** the exact inferential dependencies between them (mini argument-map), and **(c)** a short “Sellars → Brandom” bridge note for each (how this feeds the “space of reasons” framing).

## Part I — Essay 3 Notes

### 3) **“Language as Thought and as Communication” (1969)** 

**What Sellars is trying to do**

* Illuminate the *“intimate connections”* between conceptual thinking and linguistic behavior, while keeping separate: **language-as-thinking** vs **language-as-communication**. 
* In the early sections, he insists you can’t get the thought/language story right without a proper account of **rules** and what it is to be **rule-governed**. 

### A. Core distinctions (the “machinery”)

**1) Rules of action vs rules of criticism**

* **Rules of action** (“ought-to-dos”): what an agent ought to *do* in circumstances C; conformity involves recognizing C and setting about doing A. 
* **Rules of criticism** (“ought-to-bes”): how something ought to *be*; they “point beyond themselves” and (roughly) imply corresponding ought-to-dos (“bring it about that…”). 
* Big payoff: lots of the linguistic “rules” epistemologists care about are **ought-to-bes**, which lets Sellars keep language *thoroughly rule-governed* without making language-use depend on already having the relevant concepts. 

**2) The linguistic community is diachronic**

* Learners can be *trained into* conforming to linguistic ought-to-bes **before** they can “grasp”/state them; later they become teachers/critics themselves. 

### B. The key move: “thinking-out-loud”

**Sellars’ “verbal behaviorism” motif** (in this essay’s register)

* He treats some utterings that p as genuine cases of *thinking that p*—specifically, as **thinking-out-loud**. 
* Thinking-out-loud is **not** (as such) an audience-directed social act; it’s meant to undercut the idea that language is *primarily* a tool for expressing already-formed inner thoughts. 

### C. “Express” has three different senses (don’t mix them)

Sellars draws a sharp three-way distinction:

* **Action sense**: *Jones expressed his belief that-p by saying…* (intentional, communicative action)
* **Causal sense**: *Jones’ utterance expressed his thought that-p* (expression as manifestation)
* **Logical/semantical sense**: *the utterance expressed the thought that-p* (utterance as bearer of propositional content) 

A recurring lesson: if you slide between these, you’ll end up “explaining” meaning and thought in the wrong direction.

### D. Belief as a disposition (and the behaviorist refinement)

* Working characterization: **believing that p** involves a **settled disposition** (not a one-off episode) to think that p. 
* Later, he shows how a logical behaviorist can treat the “covert” side of thinking using *proximate/short-term dispositions* (not inner episodes as little ghostly acts): belief = settled disposition to have **short-term, proximate** dispositions to think-out-loud that p when the question arises (roughly). 

### E. How this connects back to essays 1–2

* Essay 2’s picture of learning/conforming vs obeying rules is now retooled with the more explicit **ought-to-be / ought-to-do** distinction, and the “community” story becomes essential (learners → teachers). 
* Essay 3 also sets up the next essay’s theme: meaning-talk is not primarily word↔thing relations, but a way of *classifying roles* and *tracking rule-governed patterns*.

---

## Part I — Essay 4 Notes

### 4) **“Meaning as Functional Classification: A Perspective on the Relation of Syntax to Semantics” (1974)** 

**What Sellars is trying to do**

* He takes Gilbert Harman’s “three levels of meaning” framing and focuses on **Level 1**: language as the medium of (distinctively human) thinking. 
* He proposes a deliberately coarse “proto-psychological” framework—**Verbal Behaviorism (VB)**—as a tool for clarifying meaning without leaning on inner “conceptual episodes.” 

### A. Verbal Behaviorism (VB): the working model

* **Primary**: thinking that p (in the “thought occurred to one” sense) = **saying p**.
* **Secondary**: thinking that p = a **short-term proximate propensity** to say p (sometimes “blocked,” e.g., by not being in a thinking-out-loud frame of mind). 

### B. Meaning as role: “functional classification”

Sellars’ headline claim (for this essay):

* To say what someone says—or what an utterance says—is to give a **functional classification** of that linguistic episode, using “illustrating” expressions drawn from the hearer’s background language. 

This inherits Essay 2’s triad, now treated as the core of meaning-bearing functioning:

* **Language entry** (world → word),
* **Intra-linguistic moves** (inference patterns, including negative constraints),
* **Language departure** (word → action). 

### C. Rules + training again: pattern-governed behavior

* Meaningful performance can exist “just” as trained **uniformities** (especially **negative** uniformities: avoiding certain combinations), before full explicit rule-grasping. 
* Trainers/critics operate with explicit norms; learners initially *conform* without yet being able to *state* rules—again the diachronic community picture. 

### D. The “means” revolution: meaning claims are not word↔object relations

**Key example:** **“‘und’ (in German) means and”** 
Sellars’ analysis (compressed):

* The subject term behaves like a **distributive singular term** (think: “the lion is tawny” ≈ “lions are tawny”), not a name of a Platonic “word-entity.” 
* What follows “means” is functioning as an **illustrating functional sortal** (Sellars’ dot-quote device):

  * **‘und’s are •and•s** (i.e., items in German that play the role our “and” plays). 
* So **“means” is not a relation-word** here; it’s a specialized copula used to **classify by role/use**. 

### E. “Stands for triangularity”: nominalization without Platonism

He extends the same strategy to apparently Platonist-looking talk like:

* **“‘dreieckig’ stands for triangularity”** 

Core move:

* Treat **“triangularity”** as a *metalinguistic* distributive singular term built out of a functional sortal; nominalizations like **-ity, -ness, -tion, that…** function like quoting devices that manufacture metalinguistic classifiers. 
* Bottom line: you can keep abstract-entity talk, but its underlying “cash value” is talk about **roles/rules/tokens**—and in principle you can “unfold” it into talk of linguistic/conceptual tokens. 

### F. Identity/similarity of meanings = identity/similarity of roles

* “Attribute identity conditions” become: **same role in the rule-governed system** (with room for graded similarity, like chess-piece analogies). 
* He emphasizes flexibility: what counts as “the same function” can be generic vs specific depending on context/purpose (e.g., Euclidean vs Riemannian “triangular”). 

---

## Quick “carry-forward” glossary (for your Part I notes)

* **Ought-to-do / Rules of action** vs **Ought-to-be / Rules of criticism**  
* **Thinking-out-loud**: a primary model for thinking in the coarse-grained framework 
* **Three senses of “express”**: action / causal / logical-semantic 
* **VB (Verbal Behaviorism)**: thinking that p ≈ saying p (or a proximate propensity to say p) 
* **Meaning as functional classification**: meaning-claims classify expressions by *role* (not word↔object relations)  

If you want, next we can do a short “Part I synthesis” page (how 1–4 lock together: material inference → language games → thought/communication → functional semantics) so Part I reads like one continuous argument rather than four separate essays.

## Part I Synthesis — how Essays 1–4 form one continuous argument

### The overarching Sellarsian bet

Part I is trying to make a single picture feel inevitable:

> **Meaning and conceptual content are not “word–world relations” added on top of language.**
> They are **roles in a rule-governed practice**—roles articulated by what speakers are *licensed* or *required* to do (especially **inferentially**) and by how language hooks into perception and action.

Each essay pushes the next step of that story.

---

## 1) Start with inference: why “therefore” is not just formal (Essay 1)

**Problem:** Ordinary reasoning has a “must” that isn’t captured by logic alone.
Sellars focuses on **material inferences**—good transitions that depend on *which* descriptive terms are involved, not just logical form. Carnap’s framework lets him mark the contrast between L-rules (formal) and P-rules (material), but the deep point is: **P-rules aren’t merely dispensable shorthand** if you take seriously the functions they serve (notably in subjunctive/necessitating discourse).

**Key shift:** a rule of inference is not a “structural relation” between inscriptions; it’s a **norm governing asserting**—a rule of *conditional assertibility* (permissible/impermissible moves). 

**Modal payoff:** Once rules are seen as norms, modal vocabulary can be understood as a way of *expressing* (Sellars says “transposing”) those norms. Modal claims “convey” the speaker’s rule-governed stance rather than straightforwardly describing a special modal fact. 

**Meaning payoff:** After rejecting the idea that “semantic rules” magically attach basic predicates to extra-linguistic meanings (because rule-application already presupposes conceptual capacities), Sellars lands on the thesis that **material transformation rules are meaning-constitutive**—they “determine the descriptive meaning” of expressions (within a logical framework). 

So Essay 1 ends with an inferentialist, norm-first picture:

* **Rules are normative** (about what one may/ought to assert) 
* **Modal talk is norm-tracking** 
* **Meaning is inferential role, centrally including material rules** 

But now we need a *practice model* that makes this livable—especially for learning.

---

## 2) Move to practices: language as a game with entry/inference/exit (Essay 2)

**Immediate obstacle:** “Learning a language = learning rules” looks self-defeating (regress: rules are stated in a metalanguage, which would require another metalanguage, etc.). Essay 2 is Sellars’ reply: keep the normativity, but fix the learning story.

**Core move:** distinguish **pattern-governed** competence from explicit **rule-obeying**. You can be trained into reliably “doing the right thing” in the right circumstances without already operating in a reflective metagame of stating/applying rules.

**Language-game model:** Here Sellars makes the structure concrete:

* **To occupy a position** in a language game is to **think/judge/assert**.
* **To make a move** is to **infer**. 

And—crucially—language isn’t just inference. It has three kinds of transitions:

1. **Language-entry transitions**: world/perception → linguistic position
2. **Intra-linguistic moves**: position → position (inference)
3. **Language-departure transitions**: linguistic position → action/nonlinguistic response 

This is the bridge from Essay 1’s “meaning is inferential role” to a broader functional role story: **meaning is a role in a whole economy** of entry + inference + exit.

**Meaning-talk reinterpreted:** “ ‘rot’ means red” is not (primarily) reporting a semantic relation; it’s a pedagogical/coordination device that helps “bring home” how to play the relevant game. 
That anticipates Essay 4’s more technical account of “means.”

So Essays 1–2 now yield a unified picture:

* **Norms are real** and constitutive of inference (Essay 1)
* **Norms can govern practice without requiring explicit metalinguistic grasp** (Essay 2)
* **Meaning lives in the role of expressions within entry/inference/exit patterns** (Essay 2, extending Essay 1)

Now we still need the mind-side story: how does this bear on *thought*?

---

## 3) Add the mind: thinking as (often) saying, plus a clarified norm vocabulary (Essay 3)

Essay 3 deepens the norm/practice apparatus and uses it to clarify **language as thought** vs **language as communication**.

**New normative distinction:** rules come in two forms:

* **Ought-to-do / rules of action**: what an agent ought to do in C 
* **Ought-to-be / rules of criticism**: how performances ought to be (standards of correctness) 

This matters because it explains how we can evaluate performances as correct/incorrect *even when* the performer is not explicitly following a formulated rule of action—tying directly back to Essay 2’s pattern-governed learning.

**Thinking-out-loud:** Sellars then presses a provocative but strategically important thought: some utterings that p are not (primarily) communicative acts; they are **episodes of thinking**—thinking-out-loud. 
That helps reverse the “inner thought → outer speech” order of explanation: instead of treating language as merely expressing already-made inner contents, he treats overt linguistic episodes (in their normative roles) as a primary anchor for the concept of thinking.

**Avoiding category-mistakes about “expression”:** he separates three senses of “express” (action/communicative, causal/manifestation, and logical-semantic/content-bearing). 
That’s a quiet structural move: it prevents you from smuggling in a ghostly inner “meaning grasp” as the thing that makes speech meaningful.

So Essay 3 is the psychological/theoretical hinge:

* it keeps the **norm-governed practice** story,
* explains how learning/criticism works across a community,
* and connects it to a non-Cartesian picture of **thought as essentially tied to linguistic roles**.

Now we can finally say what “meaning statements” are doing without reifying meanings.

---

## 4) Rebuild semantics: “means” as classificatory, not relational (Essay 4)

Essay 4 gives the most explicit semantic moral of Parts 1–3:

> To state what an utterance means is to **functionally classify** it—by saying what role it plays in a language game (entry/inference/exit), using vocabulary the interpreter already commands. 

This is the explicit “semantic” completion of Essay 2’s pedagogical point and Essay 1’s anti–semantic-rule argument.

**The “und” test case:** “‘und’ (in German) means and.”
Sellars analyzes this not as naming a relation between a word and an abstract meaning-entity, but as saying: German **und**-tokens are items of the same functional type as our **and**-tokens (his dot-quote device). 
The decisive claim: **“means” is not a relation-word** here; it’s a specialized copula for **classification by role/use**. 

That neatly locks the whole arc:

* Essay 1: meaning is not bestowed by “semantic rules”; it’s inferential-role constituted 
* Essay 2: meaning-talk is practical guidance about game roles 
* Essay 3: thought is internally connected to those role-governed linguistic episodes 
* Essay 4: semantic vocabulary (“means”) is a tool for **classifying** such roles, not positing relations 

---

## One-line “continuous argument” version

1. **Material inferences are real** and governed by **norms of assertion** (not just formal relations). 
2. Therefore, **meaning is inferentially articulated**, centrally via material rules. 
3. To make that intelligible, language must be seen as a **practice** with positions/moves and **entry/inference/exit** transitions; learners can be **pattern-governed** before they’re explicit rule-obeyers. 
4. Thought is not an inner realm that language merely reports; it is deeply tied to these norm-governed episodes (thinking-out-loud as a key model). 
5. So semantic statements don’t report word–meaning relations: they **classify functional roles** (“means” as copula).  

---

## Why this matters for the rest of the book

Part I is basically the “front-end” of Sellars’ broader project: **the space of reasons is a space of rule-governed statuses** (commitments/entitlements), and language is the medium in which those statuses are articulated. Once you buy Part I’s inferential + normative + practice-first approach, later Sellarsian moves—especially around observation, “the given,” and the structure of empirical knowledge—have a clear stage to happen on.

If you want, for Part II I can keep the same workflow: two essays at a time, plus a short synthesis after Part II (so the whole book builds as a staircase rather than a pile).
