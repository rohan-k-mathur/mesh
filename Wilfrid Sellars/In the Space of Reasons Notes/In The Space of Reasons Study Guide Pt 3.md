According to a document from **2007** (the Harvard University Press volume *In the Space of Reasons: Selected Essays of Wilfrid Sellars*), Part III (“Mind, Language, and the World”) begins with **Essay 8: “Being and Being Known”** and **Essay 9: “The Lever of Archimedes.”**

Below: (1) the **short bridge page** you requested, then (2) granular notes on **Essays 8 and 9**.

## Bridge page: How Part II’s nominalism about abstracta sets up Part III’s “mind/world” moves

### 1) What Part II gives you: “abstracta” as *roles in a practice*, not spooky objects

Part II (“Abstract Entities”) is Sellars doing a very specific kind of *nominalism*: he wants to keep the explanatory/normative work we do with talk of **properties**, **propositions**, **meanings**, etc., *without* treating those as special abstract objects.

A key device is **dot-quotation**: dot-quoted expressions are used to talk about **linguistic types/roles**, not about the concrete ink-marks/sounds as such. Sellars explicitly says we can keep using dot-quotes to refer to linguistic types even though a dot-quoted type is not essentially tied to the *shape* of the quoted English design (e.g., a •triangular• could be realized by German *dreieckig*).

He also develops hybrid “illustrating” role-sortals (like **(•triangular• INDCON)**) to reconstruct what looks like reference to an abstract entity (“triangularity”) as talk about a **type/role** that tokens can play in inference/implication and translation rubrics.

**Big upshot:** Part II teaches you to read Sellars as constantly asking:

> Instead of positing an entity, can we redescribe what we’re doing as classifying *role-players* inside a rule-governed practice?

That “role-first” strategy is exactly what reappears in Part III.

---

### 2) The Part III twist: mental episodes become *real-order role-players* that can also “mean”

Part III’s headline problem is: **how do mind and world hook up** without invoking a “Given,” inner objects, or magical intentional relations?

Sellars’s bridge-move is to treat the mental as having **two dimensions**:

1. a **logical/conceptual dimension** (norms, reasons, what counts as saying/thinking that p), and
2. a **real/causal dimension** (the kinds of states organisms/brains/robots are in).

Part III makes this explicit by returning to the idea that what connects the “logical order” to the “real order” is **role-playing**: *items in the real order play roles* analogous to roles in language. Sellars even frames it as: the logical–real “relationship” is ultimately a matter of real items playing roles—compare how the “chess order” relates to ordinary descriptive facts.

That is the explicit point where Part II’s “roles” framework becomes a theory of mind: **mental episodes can be introduced as inner role-players** that are *like* linguistic episodes (but not identical to them).

---

### 3) Why dot-quotes come back in Part III: naming “inner words”

In Essay 8, Sellars treats “mental words/sentences” as **inner counterparts** of overt speech—so dot-quotes naturally reappear because we again need a way of talking about *types/contents* rather than about occult objects.

He gives the template: a mental sentence like **•It is raining•** is the inner counterpart of the English sentence “It is raining”; that is an isomorphism in the order of signification (translation-like). And then he immediately connects this to the real order: qua real, the intellect *pictures the world*, and he goes so far as to suggest the intellect (in the real order) is the **central nervous system**.

So dot-quotes + roles aren’t a side-topic: they’re the machinery for explaining how “inner episodes” can have *content* without being inner objects that are Given.

---

### 4) The other bridge concept: two kinds of “isomorphism” (picturing vs signifying)

Part III also sharpens a distinction you can already feel in Part II:

* **Signifying**: semantic/linguistic-role relations (a *logical-order* matter)
* **Picturing**: a structural correspondence in the *real order* (a causal/nomological matter)

Sellars’s robot example is the bridge-image: patterns “picture” the world only given a whole mechanistic “method of projection” (how they’re produced/used), and this picturing is explicitly an **isomorphism in the real order**.

Then: signifying/translation *rests on* picturing. Our willingness to treat a robot-pattern as a symbol translating as “lightning” depends on recognizing a real-order isomorphism between pattern-role in the robot and lightning’s role in the environment.

**So Part II → Part III in one line:**
Part II gives you **semantic roles** without abstracta; Part III turns those roles into a mind/world story by making mental episodes into **real-order role-players** that both (a) participate in inferential/normative space and (b) are causal picturers.

---

## Essay 8 notes: “Being and Being Known” (1960)

**Context note:** This was originally delivered in 1960 and published in the *Proceedings of the American Catholic Philosophical Association*.

### A. The guiding question

Sellars takes up a Thomistic slogan: **knowing requires some isomorphism between knower and known**—and he basically says: yes, but the slogan is easy to misunderstand, because there are *different* isomorphisms in play.

He also highlights a central Thomistic claim: intellectual acts differ intrinsically (not merely relationally) because they differ by **content**—and he wants to preserve something like that while stripping away confusions that generate (e.g.) immaterial-intellect conclusions.

### B. Three core “Sellars moves” in this essay

#### 1) Mental content via a “mental language” (dot-quotes return)

A recurring Sellars strategy: treat thoughts as **inner-speech-like** episodes. In the later wrap-up of this line, he says explicitly that “mental sentences” are counterparts of overt sentences; e.g. **•It is raining•** is inner counterpart of “It is raining,” and this is an isomorphism in the **order of signification** (translation-analogue).

That’s the Part II apparatus now doing philosophy of mind: dot-quoted types let you talk about *contents* without reifying “propositions” as abstract objects.

#### 2) The crucial negative thesis: sensations are not in the intentional/conceptual order

Sellars draws a hard line: **sense** is necessary for conceptual activity, but **does not itself belong to the intentional order** (i.e., it isn’t itself already conceptual/contentful in the relevant way).

He diagnoses a major temptation: because we say things like “a sensation of a white triangle,” we slide into thinking sensations are “about” triangles the way thoughts are. Sellars insists that this is at best a kind of **pseudo-intentionality**—a grammatical shadow cast by our way of talking.

A key clarifying analogy he gives later (and which becomes crucial in Essay 9) is: *a case of sensing bluely can occur without being aware of a case of blue as a case of blue*—so the “sensing” itself needn’t already be in the cognitive/epistemic domain.

#### 3) The positive replacement: distinguish **picturing** from **signifying**

This is the main architectonic payoff:

* **Picturing** = real-order isomorphism (structural correspondence that depends on how a system functions)
* **Signifying** = conceptual/logical-order relation (meaning-role/use; translation, inferential role, etc.)

The robot example is Sellars’s way of showing that you can have real-order picturing without “immaterially” containing the object. A robot “pictures” lightning via the *place* of certain patterns in its internal system corresponding to the place of lightning in the environment; that’s a real-order isomorphism, and it blocks the “immaterial being” picture.

He then explicitly ties signifying to this: our treating a robot-pattern as translating as “lightning” rests on recognizing the real-order isomorphism; picturing is a presupposition of signification/translation.

### C. What Sellars is attacking: a classic confusion that generates “immaterial intellect”

One of the sharpest passages is where he says: if you **confuse picturing with signifying**, and you treat signifying as a relation between a word and a “real” (e.g., the “absolute nature man”), you’ll conclude that the tokening act must *embody* that nature in some special immaterial way—this becomes a primary ground for the Thomistic immaterial-intellect claim.

So Essay 8 is not “Sellars vs Aquinas” as such. It’s: Sellars wants an isomorphism thesis, but only if you keep the two isomorphisms straight.

### D. The mind/world upshot: intellect as CNS, known “directly” under analogical concepts

At the end of this trajectory Sellars offers a blunt naturalist promissory note:

* qua real-order item, the intellect is the **central nervous system**;
* Descartes’ anti-physiological argument relies on the principle that direct knowledge must present its object “in propria persona”;
* drop that principle, and it’s coherent that what we know directly as “thoughts” (under analogical concepts) are in propria persona neurophysiological states.

### E. “How this essay sets up the next one”

Essay 8 installs the key framework Essay 9 exploits:

* Sensory episodes aren’t “Given” items in the intentional order.
* To be epistemically relevant, you need something like awareness-*as* (conceptual uptake), not mere sensing.
* The mind/world link requires both **real-order picturing** and **logical-order signifying**, connected by role-playing.

### F. Quick study questions

1. Where exactly do you feel the temptation to treat sensations as “inner words,” and what is Sellars’s best reason for rejecting that?
2. In the robot case, what *makes* the internal patterns count as a “map”? (Notice his insistence that “method of projection” matters.)
3. How does “translation” depend on picturing, on Sellars’s view?

---

## Essay 9 notes: “The Lever of Archimedes” (1981)

**Context note:** This is a late essay (1981), originally the first of the Paul Carus Lectures, published in *The Monist*.

### A. The organizing metaphor and target

Sellars frames the “given” as the **fulcrum** that allegedly lets the mind “get leverage” on the world of knowledge—then immediately says: construed classically, that fulcrum is a phantom; he’s spent decades attacking it, but now wants to **reformulate and defend** the core insight more carefully.

He states his aim in a way that’s crucial for reading the whole piece: articulate the **interplay** of two dimensions epistemologists try to capture via “the given” and “coherence.”

### B. Entry point: Firth on “looks” vs “is” and a “paradox”

Sellars takes as his point of departure a text from Roderick Firth on coherence theories of justification and (briefly) of concepts.

Firth highlights a “paradox”:

* Many philosophers assume **‘looks red’ is conceptually prior to ‘is red’.**
* But if a coherence theory of concepts is right, you can’t fully understand “looks red” without the contrasting “is red,” so looks can’t come first.

That threatens the idea (from Lewis, etc.) that you can make “expressive judgments” without asserting anything about objective reality.

### C. Sellars’s signature claim (EPM-style): ‘looks’ depends on ‘is’ because the concept is one

The editors’ intro summarizes the Sellarsian line you should keep in view as you read the details: saying “A looks red” uses the same concept of red as “A is red,” but in the “looks” case you withhold endorsement that A actually is red.

Sellars uses this to attack the idea that “looks red” describes some epistemically primitive, Given, purely experiential redness.

### D. The ur-concept dispute: does “red” apply primarily to experiences or to objects?

Sellars agrees with Firth that children (before mastering the looks/is contrast) have an **ur-concept** of red—but he rejects Firth’s view that it applies primarily to experiences. Instead, Sellars says the ur-concept applies primarily to what the child will *eventually* recognize as physical objects.

The deep reason is categorial: he argues there is no determinate category of “red items” *prior to* the physical-object category; for him, being red entails being a physical object (and experiences of red are physical states of the perceiver).

So: “red” isn’t first learned as an inwardly inspected datum; it’s anchored in the world, then extended.

### E. The “seamlessness” problem and why it matters for “the given”

Sellars takes seriously a phenomenological point: in experience, “sensings” and “takings” (mere sensory goings-on vs concept-involving uptakes) don’t come in neatly separable layers; there’s a “seamlessness.”

That seamlessness pressures you toward one of two extreme conclusions:

1. “sensing” is always already “taking” (so there is no purely noncognitive sensory layer), or
2. there is a sensory layer, but then you need a story about how it can play any epistemic role without becoming a Given.

Sellars is trying to navigate between those.

### F. “Self-presenting states” and two models of epistemic authority

A major technical pivot is his discussion of **self-presenting states**.

He contrasts:

* **SP‑1**: self-presentingness grounded in “direct apprehension” (a radical apprehension/belief split).
* **SP‑2**: self-presentingness defined partly in terms of the *warrantedness* of a belief—i.e., if the person were to believe it obtains, the belief would be **noninferentially warranted/self-warranting.**

This is Sellars’s way of reworking the classical “Given” talk: instead of a mysterious apprehension that itself confers authority, he relocates epistemic authority into the normative space of **warranted belief** (while still allowing noninferential warrant).

### G. The anti-Given core: sensing ≠ awareness-as (and the “myth” in its most basic form)

Sellars’s “myth of the given” diagnosis shows up here in two connected formulations.

1. **Most basic myth-form (as the editors state it):** if you’re directly aware of an item with categorial status C, you’re aware of it *as* C.

2. **Sellars’s operational version inside the lecture:** he insists it’s logically possible for a sensing bluely to occur without awareness of a case of blue *as* a case of blue—just as sneezing can occur without being aware of it as a sneeze.

That second formulation is the “bridge” back to Essay 8: sensations (mere sensings) are not yet in the conceptual/epistemic domain; you only get epistemic standing when you have something like concept-governed “awareness-as” or belief with a place in justificatory space.

### H. How Essay 9 “locks onto” Essay 8

Essay 8 gave you:

* nonconceptual sensings (real-order goings-on) + conceptual uptakes (logical-order signifying),
* tied together without a Given by role-playing/picturing.

Essay 9 applies that framework to epistemology:

* the “Given” can’t be a foundational apprehension that carries content by itself;
* the sensory layer can be real-order, nonconceptual, and still causally involved;
* epistemic authority must be understood in terms of **warrant**, **inferential relations**, and the conceptual roles of judgments (even when warrant is noninferential).

### I. Quick study questions

1. Why does Sellars think the “ur-concept” of red belongs primarily to objects rather than experiences? What is the categorial argument supposed to buy him?
2. What philosophical work is done by distinguishing SP‑1 from SP‑2? Where does Sellars want you to land?
3. Track the “awareness-as” theme: how does it function as an anti-Given principle?

---

If you want, next we can do a **Part III mini-synthesis after Essays 8–11** (how picturing/signifying + anti-Given + the Jones-style “role-player” story set up “Some Reflections on Thoughts and Things” and “Mental Events”).


According to a document from **2007** (the *In the Space of Reasons* anthology), here are **granular notes for Part III, Essays 10 & 11**, followed by a **Part III mini‑synthesis (Essays 8–11)**.

---

## Essay 10 — “Some Reflections on Thoughts and Things”

### 1. What Sellars is up to in this essay

This chapter is a **big integrative “bridge”**: Sellars tries to show how you can *rationally reconstruct* (i) the concept of **thought/mental episode**, (ii) the concept of **content/sense**, and (iii) our talk of **abstracta** (triangularity, wisdom, etc.) *without* falling into (a) Platonism, (b) “the Given,” or (c) a crude behaviorism.

A lot of the machinery you’ve already seen (dot‑quotes, “roles,” functional classification) is now redeployed to build a story of **how “inner episodes” get their “aboutness”**.

---

### 2. The “classical theory of ideas” as starting framework

Sellars begins from a classic tripartite scheme:

* **(a) representings** (mental acts/episodes),
* **(b) contents** “in” representings,
* **(c) what exists “simpliciter”** (in the world).

And he stresses: something can “exist in” a representing (as content) without existing simpliciter. He then flags the **Kantian expansion**: contents include not just general contents but also **irreducibly individual contents** (and “logical contents” such as *not*, *or*, *all*, *necessary*).

**Why start here?** Because Sellars wants to show that if you take “content‑in‑the‑act” too literally, you slide into a pressure toward **Platonism** (one shared “content” in many acts → one “attribute” in many things).

---

### 3. The Platonism pressure: one-in-many and the “in” metaphor

Sellars reconstructs a very natural slide:

* If a single “content triangular” is “in” many thinkings (public/intersubjective),
* then why not let “triangularity” be “in” many triangular things (objective/true of things)?

But then you’ve got two “in”s (content‑in‑act vs attribute‑in‑thing), and it’s unclear they’re the same. If you identify them, you owe an account of “in‑esse” that covers both, and ordinary language doesn’t supply a “special copula” that avoids absurdities like “triangular thoughts.”

So he considers an alternative: **drop** the “in” metaphor and use an “**of**” relation (representings are *of* triangularity). But purely “diaphanous” acts defined only by their “of”-relations are unsatisfactory, so Sellars introduces the idea of a **counterpart attribute** of the act—something about the act by virtue of which it is “of” triangularity.

---

### 4. Turning “contents” into Fregean “senses”: two “programmatic corollaries”

Sellars then re‑describes “contents” as the kinds of things that function as **senses of expressions** (Fregean themes), and he extracts two key *guidelines*:

1. **Mental acts/intensional content** should be understood **on the model of** the relation between **linguistic episodes** and their senses.
2. The **counterpart attributes** of conceptual episodes (by virtue of which they “stand for” their senses) should be understood **on the model of** whatever it is about linguistic episodes by virtue of which they stand for their senses.

This is a major “Part III” move: **don’t start with private, intrinsically intentional episodes** and then explain language; rather, **start with language‑role and extend** those concepts to inner episodes.

---

### 5. The big trilemma: what must a *good* reconstruction avoid?

Sellars explicitly frames the problem as escaping three unsatisfying options:

* **Logical behaviorism** (no inner episodes, just behavior/dispositions),
* **Synthetic a priori / “synthetic necessary truth”** that’s left mysterious,
* **The argument from analogy** (the “my case” move: I introspect mine and infer yours).

He engages “sound phenomenology” views that insist mental‑behavior ties are **necessary** but not reducible, and he labels the core of that view “synthetic necessary truth” (necessary yet subject‑matter dependent) and insists: fine—but then we need an account of the *status* of such truths, and this essay is part of that attempt.

---

### 6. The “reconstruction program” and its two demands

Sellars says: if we’re going to explain the conceptual framework of mental acts **as a rational development**, two things must be possible:

1. **Describe linguistic practice richly enough** to introduce the framework of mental acts **without presupposing** that framework.
2. Explain how we can have **direct knowledge of our own mental acts** (the “epistemic privilege” phenomenon).

He also notes the second demand is “less interesting” because even a behaviorist has to explain why people are “privileged” about their own episodes/dispositions in certain ways.

---

### 7. Acts vs actions: rules of criticism vs rules of action

A key (often overlooked) tool here:

* **Only rules of criticism govern acts** (they’re assessable as correct/incorrect, warranted/unwarranted, etc.).
* **Actions** are governed by **rules of action**.

This helps Sellars re‑situate “thinking” as fundamentally tied to **norm-governed linguistic practice**, even when we later extend the picture to “inner” episodes. The point is not “speech acts = mere physical actions,” but that linguistic activity has a basic **representational/thinking** dimension underlying communication, and it is normatively structured.

---

### 8. The “Rylean” thought‑experiment: inventing inner episodes

Sellars imagines a linguistic community (“Ryleans”) where the central concept is **thinking‑out‑loud**. They have no mentalistic concepts; they perform only **linguistic acts** (not the practical “actions” philosophers of action study).

Then (crucially) you can introduce the hypothesis that members undergo **inner episodes analogous to thinkings‑out‑loud** that initiate processes culminating in overt thinkings‑out‑loud. Dot‑quotes let you classify these inner episodes and characterize **the counterpart attributes** by virtue of which they stand for what they stand for.

This is the **Jones‑style “role‑player” strategy**: introduce inner episodes as theoretical posits that *play certain functional/role‑defined jobs* in a norm‑governed system.

---

### 9. Dot‑quotes + counterpart attributes + promissory‑note predicates (the technical core)

Sellars’s “payoff” maneuver:

* We can classify inner episodes as **•Socrates• thoughts**, **•wise• thoughts**, **•Socrates is wise• thoughts**, etc., using dot‑quotes and analogical “stand for.”

* He introduces **promissory‑note predicates** of the form **“¢_”** to stand for the **counterpart attributes** of mental acts by virtue of which they stand for their senses. Then he argues that, “perspicuously,” these are really **common nouns formed by analogical dot‑quotes** (so “¢triangular acts” becomes “•triangular• acts”).

* He warns about generating **two triangularities** (one for overt thinkings‑out‑loud, one for inner episodes). Solution: **coalesce** the original and analogical dot‑quote uses so the resulting sortals apply to both outer and inner “speech,” letting both •triangular• thoughts‑out‑loud and •triangular• inner episodes stand for the same •triangular•.

**Why this matters:** it’s Sellars’s way of giving you “content” and “aboutness” **without** treating abstracta as spooky objects and **without** treating mental “meaning” as primitive “inner pointing.”

---

### 10. A quick orientation to how Essay 10 sets up Essay 11

Essay 10 builds the *conceptual genealogy*: inner episodes get their “standing‑for” status by being slotted into a role‑structured practice whose paradigm is linguistic.

Essay 11 then asks: OK, but **what are representational systems in the order of being** (not just in the order of knowing)? That’s where the theory of predication + animal RS comes in.

---

## Essay 11 — “Mental Events”

### 1. Opening clarification: Sellars is not saying “thoughts are linguistic”

He complains he’s often read as claiming that **mental events (thoughts)** are linguistic events. He says that’s a misunderstanding: what he holds is that **members of a certain class of linguistic events are thoughts** (not that *all* thoughts are linguistic).

So: linguistic episodes are one **paradigm** of thought (primary *for us*), but the ontology of thought is not settled by that methodological starting point.

---

### 2. “Order of knowing” vs “order of being”: why we need a theory of representational systems

Sellars’s big methodological thesis:

* **Thinking‑out‑loud** is our **conceptual point of entry** into the mental (order of knowing).
* But it is *not* what thinking is **in the order of being**.
* To grasp thinking in the order of being, we need a general **theory of representational systems (RSs)**.

He makes an explicit analogy: just as our “middle‑sized object” concepts are our entry into the physical but not the deep ontology of the physical, so too with thinking‑out‑loud and the mental.

And this sets up the obvious pressure: animals have RSs but not languages—so do they think? are they intentional? We can’t even frame those questions well until we clarify our intentional vocabulary as applied to language (the “methodologically primary domain”).

---

### 3. Semantics is not a “language ↔ world” relation (in the naïve sense)

A major “Part I + Part II” theme returns: meaning and intentional vocabulary **do not primarily describe relations** between linguistic items and extra‑linguistic reality.

Sellars targets the assumption that contexts like:

* “E (in L) means …”
* “E stands for …”

must name relations between words and things. He says: that presupposition is false; these “meaning contexts” are not relational in that way. Instead, they function to **classify expressions** by appeal to one’s background language. He shows this by rewriting:

* “‘und’ (in German) means and” → “‘und’s are •and•s” (where “means” behaves like a **specialized copula** and dot‑quotes yield a **common noun/sortal**).

He adds: dot‑quoted expressions can have their criteria given **functionally**, so they’re not tied to what the expression looks/sounds like. That’s how they can unify “and,” “und,” and “et” under •and•.

---

### 4. “Stands for” and abstracta: “triangularity” as “the •triangular•”

Sellars extends the same maneuver to “stands for”:

* “‘triangular’ stands for triangularity” is unpacked as “‘triangular’s are •triangular•s,” and “triangularity” is “the •triangular•.”
* He even treats “-ity” and “that” as (functionally) **quoting devices**: “triangularity” and “that is triangular” can be taken as definitional variants in this framework.
* So “stands for” is also a specialized copula, not a relation that forces abstract entities into the ontology as objects referred to by predicates.

This is exactly the Part II nominalist apparatus reappearing *inside* a theory of mind and representation.

---

### 5. The core of the essay: a theory of predication as a theory of representational “character”

Sellars now needs to say: if meaning is functional classification and “stands for” is copular, **what makes a representational episode represent the world as thus‑and‑so?**

His answer is **predication**: representation involves a symbol representing an object *and* a “characterizing” factor by virtue of which it represents that object as having a character.

He gives a general schema:

* “φd represents a as φ by virtue of ‘a’ being φ*”
* and more generally: a symbol represents x as φ by having a **counterpart character φ***; two symbols represent x and y as R by standing in a **counterpart relation R***.

Crucially, in the linguistic case, φ* can involve auxiliary sign‑designs (“red”), but it **doesn’t have to**. You could mark predication by typography (boldface) or spatial layout. That’s meant to de‑reify predicates: they’re “auxiliary” devices whose job is to confer **character** on the representing token, not to name universals.

---

### 6. “Responds to as” vs “is aware of as”: the rat example

Sellars then pushes into non‑linguistic RSs:

* Awareness “as green” is a response to an item as green, but *not* every such response counts as awareness‑as.
* An iron filing “responds to” a magnet “as a magnet” only in a **causal** sense, not as awareness.
* A rat trained to leap at triangles responds to triangles “as triangles,” but it’s a mistake to infer it has even an “ur‑concept” of a triangle just from that training; you need richer integration into an RS (inferential connections, mapping/strategy, etc.).

The larger point: representational “aboutness” isn’t a simple one‑to‑one “symbol/object” correlation; it essentially involves systematic relations among states and their tie‑in to action and inference.

---

### 7. Sellars’s summary picture of RS and the “two characters” of a mental event

Near the end he offers a compact “interconnection” summary:

* The core of “mental event” is “representational event.”
* A basic representational event has **two characters**: one by which it represents an object; another by which it represents that object **as** having a character.
* In subject‑predicate language, the “characterizing symbol” is typically misunderstood: it doesn’t represent an entity (a universal), it gives the episode a character by virtue of which it represents its object as F / as R‑related.
* Misunderstanding predicates as mere flatus vocis fuels two errors:

  1. mental events essentially involve abstract entities;
  2. subject‑predicate structure marks a radical divide between linguistic and nonlinguistic RSs.
* His emphasized thesis: prelinguistic RSs can share the duality of **referring/characterizing** even without explicit “subjects/predicates”; separating them into distinct symbols is (from this standpoint) superficial, though it can enable sophistication (logic‑using RS).

---

## Part III mini‑synthesis (Essays 8–11): the continuous argument

Here’s one clean way to see Part III as a *single* arc rather than four separate pieces:

### A. Two dimensions of representation: picturing vs signifying (Essay 8)

Sellars separates two representational dimensions:

* **Picturing**: representation as a kind of structural mapping/isomorphism (what “pictures” what).
* **Signifying**: representation as the *norm‑governed*, language‑involving dimension.

And he stresses they can come apart: a sign design can “picture” *without* “signifying.”

This sets up a guiding thought for the rest of Part III: **don’t collapse intentionality into either mere causal correspondence (picturing) or mere normative role (signifying)**. You need both, but you need them in the right order.

---

### B. Anti‑Given: why “direct awareness” can’t do foundational work (Essay 9)

Sellars then tightens the anti‑Given constraint: the “most basic form” of the Myth of the Given says that if you’re directly aware of an impression, that alone could yield knowledge. But he argues: if someone is directly aware of an impression, that entails awareness of it **as** having a character—so the awareness is already concept‑laden/norm‑structured in the relevant sense (it can’t be a bare Given).

So Part III is now boxed into a distinctive task: **build intentionality without “Given” mental items that self‑announce their content.**

---

### C. The Jones/Ryleans “role‑player” move: inner episodes as theoretical posits (Essay 10)

Given (A) and (B), Sellars’s next move is almost forced:

* If content isn’t Given, and
* if signifying is norm‑governed and public,

then the concept of **inner episodes with content** has to be explained by a story about how such a concept could be *introduced*—a rational reconstruction. Essay 10 supplies exactly that via the Ryleans + dot‑quotes + counterpart attributes + promissory‑note predicates, coalescing inner and outer “speech” to avoid doubling abstracta (two triangularities).

That’s the Part III “space of reasons” storyline: the intentional is instituted in a practice of rule‑governed moves (and the inner is introduced as a role within that space).

---

### D. Back to the world: what representation is in the order of being (Essay 11)

But Sellars won’t stop at conceptual genealogy. Essay 11 says: fine, our entry point is language, but what is thinking **in the order of being**? Answer: you need a general theory of RSs, where language is a sophisticated special case; animals have RSs too, and representational “as‑structure” requires systematic inferential/action integration. That’s why the “responds‑to‑as” vs “aware‑of‑as” distinction matters (rat example).

And here the dot‑quote/role apparatus reappears as semantics: meaning and “stands for” talk are ways of classifying role‑players, not reporting magical “word–thing” relations. From that vantage point, predication is the story of how representational episodes have a **character** by virtue of counterpart structure, not by “referring to universals.”

### One-sentence “lock” for Essays 8–11

**Essay 8** splits representation into picturing/signifying → **Essay 9** blocks Given‑style foundations → **Essay 10** reconstructs inner content as role‑instituted by public linguistic norms → **Essay 11** relocates those roles inside a general naturalistic theory of representational systems (predication/counterpart character, animal RS, inference/action integration).

## If you want a “close reading” target list for next time

For Essay 10, the highest-yield paragraphs to reread slowly are the ones where he:

* moves from “in” → “of” → counterpart attributes (to avoid “diaphanous acts”),
* coalesces dot‑quote uses to avoid two triangularities,
* states the reconstruction demands (especially the epistemic privilege constraint).

For Essay 11, reread the sequence:

* thinking‑out‑loud = conceptual entry, not ontology,
* meaning/stands‑for as classification via dot‑quotes,
* predication/counterpart character schema,
* and his “(a)–(i)” summary (the two‑character model + anti‑predicate‑reification moral).

Whenever you’re ready, we can move to **Part IV** (Science and the Mind) in the same two‑essay rhythm.
