Sellars and the Space of Reasons
JOHN MCDOWELL
ABSTRACT : In Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind Sellars introduces the image of
the space of reasons, and delineates a non-traditional empiricism, uncontaminated
by the Myth of the Given. Brandom takes Sellars’s drift to be against empiricism as
such, against the very idea that something deserving to be called “experience” could
be relevant to the acquisition of empirical knowledge in any way except merely
causally. In this paper I attack Brandom’s idea that we anyway need a concession to
externalism for non-inferential knowledge and suggest that in the space of reasons
Sellars’s, the experience play a more than merely causal role in a fully internalist
epistemology of observation.

§1. It was Wilfrid Sellars who introduced the image of the space of reasons.
At an important moment in “Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind”,1 he
writes that “in characterizing an episode or a state as that of knowing, we are
not giving an empirical description of that episode or state; we are placing it
in the logical space of reasons, of justifying and being able to justify what one
says” (§36).

Characterizing an episode or state as one of knowing would be claiming
that an epistemic fact obtains, to use language Sellars exploits elsewhere. The
remark about the logical space of reasons fits with his saying, in a promissory
spirit, near the beginning of the paper (§5):
[T]he idea that epistemic facts can be analyzed without remainder —even in
principle— into non–epistemic facts, whether phenomenal or behavioral, public or
private, with no matter how lavish a sprinkling of subjunctives and hypotheticals, is,
I believe, a radical mistake —a mistake of a piece with the so–called “naturalistic
fallacy” in ethics.
At another point (§17), where he must mean to be echoing this invocation of
the naturalistic fallacy, Sellars works with a contrast between epistemic facts
and natural facts. Presumably this contrast lines up with the contrast he
appeals to in the remark I began with, between placing an episode or state in
the space of reasons and giving an empirical description of it. (I shall come
back to this.)
Sellars is here endorsing a version of the thought that the concept of
knowledge belongs in a context that is, in at least some sense, “normative”.
He glosses the space of reasons as the space of justifying and being able to
justify what one says. To know that things are thus and so, one might say, is
to be in a position to state that things are thus and so with a certain sort of
entitlement. So the point of invoking the space of reasons here is to put
forward a version of the traditional conception of knowledge as justified true
belief.
§2. But the image has a wider scope than its application to the concept of
knowledge. In the most obvious interpretation, controlled by the etymology
of the word “epistemic”, epistemic facts would be restricted to the facts that
figure in the remark in which Sellars introduces the image: facts to the effect
that some episode or state is one of knowing. But at a couple of places in
“Epistemology and the Philosophy of Mind” Sellars makes it clear that his 
SELLARS AND THE SPACE OF REASONS | 3
concern extends more widely than epistemology in the etymologically
obvious sense, reflection about knowledge.
The contrast between epistemic facts and natural facts comes in a passage
in which the point is to urge that a fact to the effect that some object looks red
to someone is an epistemic fact rather than a natural fact (§17). And an
episode or state in which something looks red to someone is not one of
knowing. (Certainly not one of knowing that the thing is red. Perhaps the
subject of such a state or episode knows that some object looks red to her, but
that does not make its looking red to her itself an episode or state of knowing.)
Even more strikingly, Sellars writes of the “epistemic character” of the
expression “thinking of a celestial city” (§7). In this connection he equates
“epistemic character” with intentionality.
So “epistemic”, in Sellars’s usage, acquires a sense that cuts loose from its
etymological connection with knowledge. In the wider sense epistemic facts
relate to world–directed thought as such, whether knowledge–involving or
not. When he implies that states or episodes of looking are epistemic, his
point is that visual experiences are “thoughts” in the sense he explains
towards the end of the paper (§§56–9: see §60 for the application to “inner
perceptual episodes”). By then he is focusing on episodes rather than states,
and “thoughts” are “inner” episodes that possess conceptual content, in a way
that is to be understood by modelling them on overt linguistic performances.
An experience in which something looks red to one embodies the thought
that the thing in question actually is red. (See §16 for the idea of experiences
as, “so to speak, making” assertions or claims.)
So the remark about the space of reasons generalizes. In characterizing
an episode or a state in terms of actualization of conceptual capacities, as we
do when we say that someone is thinking of a celestial city, or that something
looks, for instance, red to someone, we are placing the episode or state in the
logical space of reasons, no less than when we characterize an episode or a
state as one of knowing.
I think it is helpful to see this generalized form of the point as anticipating
something Donald Davidson puts by saying that concepts of propositional 
4 | JOHN MCDOWELL
attitudes operate under a “constitutive ideal of rationality”.2
 Davidson says
this in the course of urging that we cannot expect applications of concepts of
propositional attitudes to line up in an orderly way with descriptions of their
compliants in terms of, for instance, neurophysiology. That corresponds to
Sellars’s denial that epistemic facts —which, in Sellars’s extended sense,
correspond quite well to the facts singled out by their involving what
Davidson calls “propositional attitudes”— can be analysed without
remainder into non–epistemic facts. And Davidson suggests an argument for
the claim of irreducibility that is more or less common between him and
Sellars.
The argument is that placing items in the space of reasons, to put it in
Sellarsian terms, serves the purpose of displaying phenomena as having a
quite special kind of intelligibility, the kind of intelligibility a phenomenon is
revealed as having when we enable ourselves to see it as manifesting
responsiveness to reasons as such. (“As such” matters here. I shall come back
to this.) An obvious case is the intelligibility that we find in behaviour when
we see it as intentional action, situating it in the context of the desires and
beliefs that inform it. But of course beliefs and desires themselves can be
made intelligible as manifestations of a responsiveness to reasons on the part
of their possessors. We place beliefs and desires in the space of reasons by
putting them in a context that includes other beliefs, other desires, and
valuations, in the light of which the beliefs and desires we are aiming to
understand are revealed as manifestations of rationality on the part of their
possessors. Talk of the space of reasons captures in metaphorical terms the
distinctive kind of pattern in which we situate things when we explain them
in this distinctive way. And Davidson’s suggestion is that this kind of pattern
is so special that there is no prospect of formulating the content of concepts
whose primary point lies in their availability for placing in the space of
reasons in terms of nothing but concepts that do not have that as their
primary point.
2 See “Mental Events”, in Davidson’s Essays on Actions and Events (Oxford: Clarendon Press,
1980).
SELLARS AND THE SPACE OF REASONS | 5
To mark this special character of space–of–reasons intelligibility,
Davidson sets it in contrast with the mode of intelligibility sought by
disciplines like physics. In, say, mechanics, we make phenomena intelligible
by revealing them as instances of ways in which things regularly happen, ways
in which things unfold in conformity to laws of nature. That is quite unlike
making phenomena intelligible by revealing them as efforts on the part of
subjects to conform to the requirements of rationality. Presumably when
Sellars invokes nature, in his contrast between the epistemic and the natural,
he means to put us in mind of some such conception of what he wants us to
see as the foil to placing things in the space of reasons. Sellars’s talk of natural
facts points to a kind of intelligibility that is characteristic, if not of physics in
particular, at least of the natural sciences in general.
And when Sellars contrasts placing things in the space of reasons with
empirical description, the point must be to suggest that empirical description
is restricted to what we go in for when we place things in nature on some such
conception. This talk of empirical description is perhaps infelicitous. It is far
from obvious that affirming what Sellars calls “epistemic facts” cannot be
grounded in experience, and when it is, there is no clear reason not to count
affirming an epistemic fact as empirical. And if empirical, why not
description? Perhaps Sellars let his wording here be skewed by the fact that
one way he tries to convey his point is by alluding to the naturalistic fallacy in
ethics. In some versions of the allegation of a naturalistic fallacy in that
context, its original home, the idea is that description is on one side of an
unbridgeable gulf, with evaluation or assessment in terms of conformity to
norms on the other. We should note, however, that when Sellars suggests his
analogue to avoidance of the naturalistic fallacy in ethics, by denying that we
can reduce epistemic facts to non–epistemic facts, he does not carry over into
his analogous context the idea that what, on pain of fallacy, we must
acknowledge to be irreducible to the natural is not factual. Epistemic facts
are facts too. So any suggestion that affirming them cannot be engaging in
description would be at least awkward by Sellars’s own lights.
In any case, I think it would be a mistake to try to bring the specialness of
space–of–reasons intelligibility into relief against a monolithic conception of 
6 | JOHN MCDOWELL
intelligibility that is not of the space–of–reasons kind. Intelligibility does not
divide exhaustively into the space–of–reasons kind, on the one hand, and the
kind that is sought by physics, Davidson’s favoured foil, on the other. Perhaps
it is better to bring space–of–reasons intelligibility into focus by contrasting
it with the intelligibility that corresponds to natural–scientific understanding
in general, as in my suggested reading of Sellars’s contrast of epistemic facts
with natural facts. But this contrast does not require a unified conception of
a kind of intelligibility that corresponds to natural–scientific understanding,
common as between physics and, say, biology. The basic thought is that
placing in the space of reasons is special in being quite unlike any other way
of revealing phenomena as intelligible. There is no need for a
characterization of intelligibility that is not of the space–of–reasons kind
more specific than just that, that it is not of the space–of–reasons kind.
Here I am correcting a line I have previously taken. In my book Mind and
World,
3 when I tried to capture the Sellarsian idea that placing in the space of
reasons is special, I did so by appealing to a contrast with placing in the realm
of natural law, the sort of thing we do in mechanics. So far that is perhaps all
right. There is indeed a sharp contrast there. But subsuming under law
should figure only as a particularly vivid example of a way of revealing
intelligibility that is other than placing in the space of reasons; whereas I left
it looking as if placing phenomena in the space of reasons and subsuming
them under natural law were supposed to exhaust the alternative possibilities
for finding things intelligible.
§3. Sellars glosses the logical space of reasons as the space of justifying and
being able to justify what one says. I paraphrased this by saying that to know
that things are thus and so is to have a certain sort of entitlement for saying
that things are thus and so. Of course this does not imply that a knower needs
to say that things are thus and so in order to count as knowing it. The point
is just that if she were to say that things are thus and so, she would be entitled
to her statement. As I said, Sellars is putting forward a version of the
3 Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1994; reissued with a new introduction, 1996.
SELLARS AND THE SPACE OF REASONS | 7
traditional conception of knowledge as justified true belief, true belief that the
believer is entitled to.
But it matters that Sellars introduces the space of reasons as a space
occupied by speakers, people who can say things and justify what they say.
From what I have said so far, it might seem that the space of reasons might
also be occupied by non–speakers. It might seem that justificatory relations
between things one can say figure only as a particularly striking case of
justificatory relations in general, which, on this account, might equally hold
between postures or frames of mind adopted by non–language–using
animals. But to read Sellars this way would be to ignore the role in his
thinking of what he calls “psychological nominalism” (see §§29, 31).
Psychological nominalism is the thesis that “all awareness of sorts,
resemblances, facts, etc., in short all awareness of abstract entities —indeed,
all awareness even of particulars— is a linguistic affair” (§29). We tend to
picture a child, learning its first language, as already at home in “a logical
space of particulars, universals, facts, etc.” (§30). On this picture learning a
language can be a matter of simply associating words and phrases with these
already available objects of awareness. Against this, Sellars’s psychological
nominalism denies “that there is any awareness of logical space prior to, or
independent of, the acquisition of a language” (§31). So knowledge, in a sense
that implies awareness of “logical space”, can be enjoyed only by subjects who
are competent in a language. And when Sellars connects being appropriately
positioned in the space of reasons with being able to justify what one says,
that is not just a matter of singling out a particularly striking instance of
having a justified belief, as if that idea could apply equally well to beings that
cannot give linguistic expression to what they know. Sellars implies that he
sees this conception of the significance of having a language as akin to
Wittgenstein’s polemic against the “Augustinian” picture of language in
Philosophical Investigations.

 (See §30, where he sets psychological
nominalism in opposition to a different way of picturing “a child —or a

carrier of slabs— learning his first language”, and suggests that this alternative
picture yields an “Augustinian” account of thinking in presence.)
Sellars puts psychological nominalism into practice in his treatment of
“thoughts”, in the sense of “inner” episodes with conceptual content. He
explains the idea of such episodes by giving a rational reconstruction —which
he frames as a myth of his own to counter the Myth of the Given— of how
the idea could have been introduced. He begins with “our Rylean ancestors”,
who have a rich language for talking about publicly accessible reality,
including dispositional features of objects in it, but no language for talking
about “inner” occurrences (§48). To make room for the next move in Sellars’s
story, they need the capacity to talk about their own verbal behaviour, in
particular the ability to credit it with semantical characteristics. Sellars’s
mythical Jones now introduces “inner” episodes with conceptual content as
posits in a theory constructed to explain overt behaviour. Posits typically
come with a model, which enters essentially into how we are to understand
the concept of the posited items. In the case of “thoughts”, the model is overt
linguistic performances, with their semantical characteristics; that is why the
“Ryleans” need to have talk about meaningful speech already in hand, as a
basis on which Jones can equip them with the concept of “inner” episodes
with conceptual content. “Inner” episodes with conceptual content are to be
understood on the model of overt performances in which people, for instance,
say that things are thus and so. The directedness at reality of overt verbal
behaviour affords the model on which we are to understand the directedness
at reality of non–overt conceptual episodes.
As far back as Plato, philosophers have been struck by how natural it is to
conceive thinking one keeps to oneself, as opposed to thinking out loud, as
inner speech. What is distinctive about Sellars’s version of the point is a
particularly clear picture of the significance of that natural conception. The
suggestion is not, for instance, that to think otherwise than out loud is to
engage in verbal imagery. No doubt one can engage in verbal imagery when
one thinks, but that is not what Sellars is telling us thinking is. The suggestion
is, rather, that the concept of thinking otherwise than out loud is essentially 
SELLARS AND THE SPACE OF REASONS | 9
analogical in character, essentially to be grasped as an extended application
of the concept of saying things or thinking out loud.
§4. I proposed that we should connect the idea of placements in the space of
reasons with the idea of a special kind of intelligibility, exemplified by making
sense of bits of behaviour in terms of beliefs and desires, as we do when we
see behaviour as intentional action.
Now it is easy to think it cannot be right to restrict that special kind of
intelligibility to language–users. And indeed this protest is on the track of
something correct, and it will be helpful to indulge it a bit.
Animals that do not use language act in ways we can make intelligible to
ourselves by seeing how it would be attractive to act as they are acting, given
their desires and their awareness of their situation. The intelligibility we
confer in this way on a piece of behaviour —say, avoidance of danger or
pursuit of an opportunity to eat— has a character that cannot be cleanly
separated from an idea of rationality or justifiedness, especially if the
behaviour is, say, inventive or resourceful, as mere animal behaviour can be,
rather than just routine. An animal that avoids danger is not merely doing
what comes naturally to it, though it surely is doing that; it is doing what it
makes sense for it to do given its predicament. And the awarenesses of
environmental circumstances that figure in this way of making animal
behaviour intelligible are up to a point like the awarenesses of features of their
environment that are enjoyed by beings like us, who can say how they, for
instance, see that things are, thereby giving expression to knowledge that is
intended to come within the scope of Sellars’s remark that attributing
knowledge is making a placement in the space of reasons. An animal that sees
a predator, for instance, is surely in some sense justified in taking itself to be
in danger, in a way that is not completely unlike the way a human being who
sees a vehicle bearing down on her, for instance, can be justified in taking
herself to be in danger, and perhaps in saying that she is in danger. When we
make animals that do not use language intelligible in the ways we standardly
do, we use conceptual apparatus of action, desire or purpose, belief, and 
10 | JOHN MCDOWELL
sometimes knowledge, that, at least up to a point, matches the conceptual
apparatus that falls within the scope of Sellars’s claims, explicit and implicit,
about the space of reasons. Something like what Sellars says about the
irreducibility of the conceptual apparatus that concerns him seems plausible
here, and for what looks like at least a similar reason. This conceptual
apparatus has its primary home in the context of a way of making phenomena
intelligible that is controlled by an idea of what makes sense, an idea that is at
least akin to a concept of rationality. So why should we not suppose that
exploiting these concepts in application to non–linguistic animals is placing
things in the space of reasons? What is so special about language?
Sellars’s story about modelling concepts of unexpressed psychic postures
on concepts of speech acts does not by itself answer this question. What
Sellars proposes is that the concept of, for instance, perceptual awareness that
things are thus and so should be understood on the model of the concept of,
for instance, saying that things are thus and so. One might grant that, without
necessarily accepting that the modelled concepts can be applied only to
subjects to which we have occasion to apply the concepts they are modelled
on. Why should there not be concepts, ultimately modelled on concepts of
speech acts, that we can apply to animals that do not use language as well as
to animals that do?
I think we can accept something on those lines, but still hold out for the
Sellarsian idea that the acquisition of language makes a distinctive difference.
The space of reasons in the primary sense is, as I said before, the space of
reasons appreciated and responded to as such. I promised to come back to
the significance of that “as such”. It is true that a non–language–using animal
can respond to something in the light of which its response makes sense.
Consider, for instance, fleeing from danger. That is, if you like, responding
to something that is in fact a reason for the response —to put things in a
perfectly intelligible way that leads to the inclination I am considering, to
resist restricting the space of reasons to beings with language. But the case of
an animal without language, the circumstance that is in fact a reason is not
responded to as the reason it is. For that kind of locution to fit, in the sense
in which I intend it, the subject would need to be able to step back from the 
SELLARS AND THE SPACE OF REASONS | 11
fact that it is inclined in a certain direction by the circumstance. It would
need to be able to raise the question whether it should be so inclined, and
conclude that it should. Acting on the inclination —supposing the verdict of
the inquiry that is opened by this stepping back is positive— now takes on a
dimension of freedom. It was up to the agent whether to act or not. The
behaviour is no longer the mere outcome of forces that are part of an animal’s
nature. It is natural to say that this dimension of freedom is required if
behaviour is to be in a proper sense informed by rationality. And this
distanced orientation towards circumstances that otherwise would have
simply induced inclinations is made possible by language. It is the ability to
say how things are that enables one to hold a circumstance with a tendency
to influence one’s motivations at arm’s length, so as to be able to ask oneself
whether it constitutes a reason for doing what it inclines one to do.
So if occupying the space of reasons in the primary sense is being able to
respond to reasons appreciated as such, then only language users can occupy
the space of reasons in the primary sense. But this is without prejudice to the
legitimacy of finding a kinship between the sort of explanatory nexus in which
we place intentional action undertaken for reasons and the sort of
explanatory nexus in which we place purposive behaviour undertaken by
animals that cannot have the sort of distanced attitude to their predicaments
that language makes possible.
So we can adopt a Sellarsian “nominalistic” view of the space of reasons
strictly so called, but still acknowledge that the space of reasons is
interestingly similar in some ways to an explanatory space already occupied
by animals without language. This allows us to take quite seriously how
natural it is to credit animals that do not use language with purposes and
awarenesses. And there is no need to deny the awarenesses the title of
knowledge, even though they do not come within the scope of Sellars’s
remark about that concept. We can reserve the concept of the conceptual for
language–users without needing to deny that the concepts whose application
in our case implies the operations of our conceptual capacities —such
concepts as those of belief, desire, and knowledge— also apply, without those
implications, in the lives of non–language–users.
12 | JOHN MCDOWELL
Sellars singles out creatures with language as unique in being capable of
“thought” in a certain sense. Philosophers who agree with Sellars on the
significance of language often take themselves to be obliged to hold that the
application of concepts such as those of belief and awareness to creatures
without language, and so without thought in the relevant sense, is a kind of
courtesy, not to be seriously meant. The star example of this is Descartes,
who conceives thoughtless brutes as mere automata.5
 But there is nothing in
the fundamental shape of Sellars’s psychological nominalism that requires
this kind of move.
If we make language a requirement for occupying the space of reasons
strictly so called, we insist on a discontinuity in animal life, between our lives
and those of all other animals (at least so far as we know). What I have been
urging is that this does not prevent us from also acknowledging a continuity.
We do not need to suppose that the relation between a reason and what it is
a reason for springs into being out of nothing with the onset of language. It
has intelligible precursors in the relations between goals, awarenesses, and
behaviour that already shape stretches of the lives of animals without
language.
I do not mean to imply that the whole truth about what is required for a
subject to be in the space of reasons in the strict sense is exhausted by the
subject’s being responsive, in the way that allows for stepping back and raising
critical questions, to circumstances in the light of which merely animal
behaviour, without the distanced orientation, would anyway have made
sense. On the contrary, there is clearly more to coming to occupy the space
of reasons than this transfiguration of practical intelligence. I suggested that
it is the ability to say how things are that enables a distanced attitude towards
a feature of one’s environment. The ability to say how things are presupposes
responsiveness to theoretical reasons. And that brings into play stretches of

University Press, 1979), pp. 188–92; and Robert Brandom, “Knowledge and the Social
Articulation of the Space of Reasons”, Philosophy and Phenomenological Research lv (1995),
pp. 899–900 (n. 3).
SELLARS AND THE SPACE OF REASONS | 13
the space of reasons that, unlike the most basic practical reasons, have no
counterpart in shaping the lives of non–rational animals.
I spoke of restricting the concept of the conceptual to occupants of the
space of reasons in Sellars’s strict sense. It is important to be clear that this is
a terminological choice. It is not optional, in Sellars’s thinking, to mark the
discontinuity between occupants of the space of reasons in the strict sense
and everything else. Giving that up would be abandoning psychological
nominalism. But it is not obligatory to mark the discontinuity by denying
conceptual capacities to non–rational animals. Some people prefer to align
the concept of the conceptual with the continuity that I am insisting we do
not need to deny or downplay, so that an animal’s intelligent flight behaviour,
for instance, might show that it possesses the concept of danger. The
restricted conception of the conceptual that I am finding in Sellars is not to
be seen as taking issue with this preference on a question of fact. It is not that
possession of conceptual capacities constitutes an independently identifiable
natural kind —like, say, possession of opposable thumbs— with the choice
between the Sellarsian way of talking and this alternative turning on
substantive questions about how wide the extension of the kind is. The issue
here is rather between two different stipulations about the most useful way to
employ something that ought to be seen as a term of art.
§5. When Sellars introduces the space of reasons, he is giving expression to a
robust epistemological internalism, at least about knowledge in the
application that belongs in the space of reasons in the primary sense. If
knowledge is a position in the space of being able to justify what one says,
then someone who makes a claim that counts as expressing knowledge needs
to be able to vindicate her entitlement to the claim. So she needs to be aware
of the entitlement. Contrast the epistemological externalism according to
which it can suffice for a belief to count as knowledge if it results from a way
of acquiring beliefs that can be relied on, in the circumstances, to issue in true
beliefs, even if that fact about the belief’s provenance is beyond the believer’s
ken.
14 | JOHN MCDOWELL
Sellars’s epistemological internalism is comparatively unproblematic in
the case of inferential knowledge, where one knows something by virtue of
knowing something else from which there is a good inference to the belief
that thereby counts as knowledge. It would not be tempting to suppose one
could have knowledge of this kind without being aware of its credentials. But
knowledge acquired through observation is precisely not inferentially based,
and for these cases Sellars’s internalism necessitates a complexity in how we
understand the image of the space of reasons.
On a superficially attractive interpretation of the image, relations in the
space of reasons —the analogues to relations between positions in space
literally so called— are constituted by possibilities of reaching positions of
entitlement or commitment by inference from prior positions of entitlement
or commitment. This makes it hard to combine Sellars’s internalism, his
insistence that a knower must be able to display her own posture as one of
entitled belief, with preserving an application for the idea of non–inferential
knowledge. Thus Robert Brandom, who assumes that inferential construal of
the image,6 thinks countenancing non–inferential knowledge at all, as Sellars
certainly wants to, requires an exception to the internalism Sellars also wants
to endorse.7
Reliability is at least a necessary condition for a belief to count as the result
of observation. This can be framed in terms of a certain inference, and Sellars
himself puts things this way (§35). If a belief is the result of observation, then
6 At p. 158 of his Study Guide, Brandom formulates Sellars’s internalism as implying that
“for a noninferential report to express knowledge (or for the belief it expresses to constitute
knowledge), the reporter must be able to justify it, by exhibiting reasons for it.” The last
five words here are already suspect, and it becomes clear that things are going wrong when
Brandom goes on: “This is to say that the reporter must be able to exhibit it as the conclusion
of an inference, even though that is not how the commitment originally came about.” This
reflects the assumption that relations in the space of reasons are exhausted by possible
inferential routes from one position to another.
7 See, e.g., “Knowledge and the Social Articulation of the Space of Reasons”, especially at p.
904, where Brandom claims that non–inferential reports bring out an insight in externalist
approaches to epistemology.
SELLARS AND THE SPACE OF REASONS | 15
that things are as they are believed to be is the conclusion of a good inference
from the subject’s being inclined, in the circumstances, to say that things are
that way. This makes room for an inferential justification for the belief. But,
as Brandom insists, an inferential justification on these lines can be offered
by the believer herself at best ex post facto, on pain of our losing our grip on
the fact that the knowledge we are considering was supposed to be non–
inferential.8
 We do not succeed in picturing an observational stance with
respect to some state of affairs if we envisage a believer who convinces herself
that she is entitled to a belief by appealing to the “reliability inference”, on
these lines: “I find myself inclined to say this book is red, and given my
reliability about such matters in circumstances like these, there is a good
inference to the conclusion that it is red, so I shall go ahead and claim that it
is red.”
Sellars imposes a second necessary condition on observational knowledge,
in addition to the reliability condition. The second condition (§35) is that an
observational knower must be self–consciously in possession of the
observational authority that Sellars spells out in terms of the “reliability
inference”. Obviously this reflects Sellars’s epistemological internalism. Now
Brandom thinks this internalist requirement would imply a self–defeatingly
inferential picture of supposedly observational knowledge —as if one arrived
at observational knowledge as a result of persuading oneself, by way of the
“reliability inference”, that one would be justified in indulging an inclination
to say something, present to one in the first instance as a mere phenomenon
not accompanied by confidence that one would be speaking the truth if one
indulged the inclination. So Brandom concludes that the internalist
requirement is a mistake on Sellars’s part. We must set it aside if we are to
hold on to Sellars’s own thought that observational knowledge is not
inferential. An observational knower can invoke her own reliability only ex
post facto. It is a short step from here to claiming, as Brandom indeed does,
that the case remains one of observational knowledge if the believer herself is

not in a position to invoke her reliability even ex post facto. According to
Brandom, it is enough if someone else, a scorekeeper, can place the belief in
the space of reasons as the conclusion of an inference involving the subject’s
reliability, even if the believer herself does not take herself to be reliable.9
In Brandom’s view, then, Sellars’s exceptionless internalism is a mistake.
It cannot be made to cohere with the rest of what Sellars wants.
I think this rides roughshod over Sellars’s main point in the pivotal part
VIII of “Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind”, from which I have cited
his necessary conditions for observational knowledge. I shall end this paper
by sketching how Sellars’s moves there show that, contrary to Brandom’s
suggestion, he can indeed have everything he wants. This requires giving full
measure to a complexity in the way Sellars himself spells out the image of the
space of reasons, which is not adequately accommodated by Brandom’s
inferentialist interpretation of the image.
The overall aim of part VIII is to identify and correct the error in
“traditional empiricism” (§38), which answers the title question, “Does
Empirical Knowledge Have a Foundation?”, with an unqualified “Yes”.
Sellars describes “traditional empiricism” like this (§32):
One of the forms taken by the Myth of the Given is the idea that there is, indeed must
be, a structure of particular matter of fact such that (a) each fact can not only be
noninferentially known to be the case, but presupposes no other knowledge either
of particular matter of fact, or of general truths: and (b) … the noninferential
knowledge of facts belonging to this structure constitutes the ultimate court of
appeals for all factual claims —particular and general— about the world.
The crucial point is that the foundational knowledge is conceived as
presupposing no other knowledge. That is what makes this a form of the
Myth of the Given. Sellars’s attack on the Myth, in its empiricistic guise, can
9 See Making It Explicit: Reasoning, Representing, and Discursive Commitment (Cambridge,
Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1994), pp. 217–21. The idea is hinted at in Brandom’s
Study Guide to “Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind”; see pp. 157, 159.
SELLARS AND THE SPACE OF REASONS | 17
be summed up like this. First, acquiring knowledge non–inferentially is, no
less than acquiring knowledge inferentially, an exercise of conceptual
capacities. (Of course this relates only to the application of the concept of
knowledge that belongs in the space of reasons in the primary sense. Outside
that context the distinction between inferential and non–inferential
knowledge gets no grip.) Second, conceptual capacities are not innate, or
developed in merely biological maturation, but acquired in learning a
language. (This is Sellars’s psychological nominalism.) And third, even in
the case of those concepts that might seem most congenial to the atomism of
traditional empiricism, the very possession of the concepts requires
knowledge of a lot more than is stated when one gives expression to
applications of them. For instance, to have colour concepts one must know
what conditions are appropriate for telling what colour something is by
looking at it (see §19).
Knowledge of what colour something is, acquired by looking at it in a
good light, is non–inferential. It is an example of a category of knowledge,
the observational, that constitutes the ultimate court of appeals for all factual
claims about the world. Those two sentences rehearse two–thirds of the
traditional empiricist’s conception of observational knowledge. The needed
correction to traditional empiricism is to give up the other third, to give up
the idea that such knowledge can be had in self–contained chunks,
presupposing no other knowledge. And this requires a “Yes and no” answer
to the question whether empirical knowledge has foundations, instead of the
unqualified “Yes” of traditional empiricism. Sellars puts his nuanced attitude
to the image of foundations like this (§38):
If I reject the framework of traditional empiricism, it is not because I want to say that
empirical knowledge has no foundation. For to put it this way is to suggest that it is
really “empirical knowledge so–called,” and to put it in a box with rumors and
hoaxes. There is clearly some point to the picture of human knowledge as resting on
a level of propositions —observation reports— which do not rest on other
propositions in the same way as other propositions rest on them. On the other hand,
I do wish to insist that the metaphor of “foundation” is misleading in that it keeps us
from seeing that if there is a logical dimension in which other empirical propositions 
18 | JOHN MCDOWELL
rest on observation reports, there is another logical dimension in which the latter
rest on the former.
Dependence in this second logical dimension is the presupposing of other
knowledge that traditional empiricism fails to recognize. In taking note of
the second dimension, we see that what is now, just for this reason, only
misleadingly conceived as foundational knowledge presupposes knowledge
of other matters of fact, which would have to belong to the structure of
knowledge that is now only misleadingly conceived as built on those
foundations. The metaphor of foundations is misleading because one could
not even have the supposed foundations without having begun to build a
structure on them.
Someone can know what colour something is by looking at it only if she
knows enough about the effects of different sorts of illumination on colour
appearances. The essential thing for our purposes is that the relation of this
presupposed knowledge to the knowledge that presupposes it —support in
Sellars’s second dimension— is not that the presupposing knowledge is
inferentially grounded on the presupposed knowledge. That would be the
right thing to say about knowledge that rests on other knowledge in Sellars’s
first dimension, and the second dimension is different. As Sellars says at the
beginning of part VIII (§32), his aim is to attack the idea “that knowledge …
which logically presupposes knowledge of other facts must be inferential”.
Once we recognize the second, non–inferential dimension in which one
proposition can be rationally supportive of another, we can see that the
presupposed knowledge can be invoked by the subject who has the knowledge
that presupposes it —not just ex post facto, as in Brandom’s supposed
improvement on Sellars, but at the time— without threatening the status of
the presupposing knowledge as non–inferential.
Staying with the same instance to illustrate the point: I might at least
partially vindicate my claim to know that something is green —I might
suitably place my stance, with respect to the proposition that the thing is
green, in the space of reasons— by saying “This is a good light for telling the
colours of things by looking”. That can be a relevant thing to say in showing 
SELLARS AND THE SPACE OF REASONS | 19
that I am entitled to pronounce as I do about the colour of the thing. The
crucial thing is that I do not thereby cast what I say about the light as a premise
in an inferential grounding for what I claim to know about the colour of the
thing.
And something similar, though with an extra complexity, needs to be said
about invoking my own reliability. I can tell a green thing when I see one, at
least in a good light, viewed head–on, and so forth. A serviceable gloss on
that remark is to say that if I claim, in suitable circumstances, that something
is green, then it is. There is a good inference from my say–so, in these
circumstances, to its being so. As I said, that is just how Sellars introduces
the reliability condition on observational knowledge. It does not follow that
if I place my pronouncement that something is green in the space of reasons
by saying “I can tell a green thing when I see one” —invoking my self–
conscious possession of observational authority on such questions, in
conformity with Sellars’s second necessary condition— I thereby represent
myself as owing my entitlement to the claim that the thing is green to an
inference from an inclination I find in myself to say that it is. That I am
reliable about such things —if you like, that the “reliability inference” is a
good one in this case— is a condition for my being able to acquire knowledge
that things are green by looking. It is presupposed by my having
observational knowledge that things are green. It supports my observational
knowledge that things are green in Sellars’s second dimension, which he
carefully separates from the dimension in which one piece of knowledge
provides inferential grounding for another.10 There is no threat to the non–
10 Brandom’s Study Guide makes almost nothing of this. Brandom nearly exclusively explains
Sellars’s remarks against an atomistic conception of non–inferential knowledge in terms of
a requirement for understanding observational reports, that one be able to use the relevant
forms of words also as premises and conclusions of inferences. There surely is such a
requirement, but it is not Sellars’s concern in part VIII (or indeed anywhere in “Empiricism
and the Philosophy of Mind”). Sellars’s concern is a requirement for observational reports
to be intelligibly expressions of observational knowledge; for these purposes that they are
understood by someone who makes them can be taken for granted. And the relation
between observational knowledge of something’s colour and, say, knowledge about suitable
circumstances for telling colours by looking —Sellars’s first example of the sort of thing he 
20 | JOHN MCDOWELL
inferential status of observational knowledge if we insist, as Sellars does, that
my being aware of the reliability that is a requirement for me to have authority
as an observer of colours is a condition for my being an observer of colours
at all.11
The extra complication in this case is that the reliability condition can be
spelled out in terms of the goodness of an inference. But that makes no
difference to the point. Sellars insists that one’s reliability must be available
to one as something on which one’s observational knowledge rationally
depends. That is not to represent the observational knowledge in question as
inferentially dependent on anything: not on one’s own reliability, and
certainly not on one’s inclination to make an observational claim, the premise
of the “reliability inference”.
So Sellars’s internalism coheres with a perfectly intuitive conception of
observational knowledge as non–inferential. What needs to be discarded is
not the internalism, but Brandom’s monolithically inferentialist
understanding of the topography of the space of reasons. This contradicts
is concerned with— is not inferential. At p. 162, expounding §38, Brandom cannot avoid
letting a glimpse of Sellars’s real point emerge, when he says that observation reports
“themselves rest (not inferentially but in the order of understanding and sometimes of
justification) on other sorts of knowledge”. (This is why I said he makes almost nothing of
the point.) But the stress on the order of understanding is an importation. And nothing in
the rest of what Brandom says about part VIII explains or warrants the thought that
suddenly makes its appearance here, that observation reports can depend in the order of
justification, but not inferentially, on other sorts of knowledge. This —with “always”
instead of “sometimes”— is just Sellars’s thesis. The point contradicts Brandom’s
inferentialist interpretation of the space of reasons (the order of justification), and it destroys
the supposed basis for Brandom’s idea that Sellars’s internalism is a mistake.
11 Sellars thinks one needs inductive grounds for the proposition that one is reliable, and he
works (§§36, 37) to avoid representing the capacity for observational employment of a
concept, which he is urging requires awareness of one’s own reliability, as needed in advance
for amassing the inductive grounds. (That would be circular, as he notes.) But I think the
idea that confidence in one’s own reliability needs inductive grounds is a mistake. Anyway,
we do not need to consider this issue in order to appreciate the broad shape of Sellars’s
thinking about observational knowledge.
SELLARS AND THE SPACE OF REASONS | 21
Sellars’s insistence on the two different dimensions in which one proposition
can rest on another.
I have been attacking Brandom’s idea that we anyway need a concession
to externalism for non–inferential knowledge. This idea helps to sustain a
blindness on Brandom’s part to the role played by experience, self–
consciously enjoyed, in Sellars’s internalistic conception of observational
knowledge. In “Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind” Sellars delineates a
non–traditional empiricism, uncontaminated by the Myth of the Given.
Misreading crucial stretches of the text, Brandom, on the contrary, takes
Sellars’s drift to be against empiricism as such, against the very idea that
something deserving to be called “experience” could be relevant to the
acquisition of empirical knowledge in any way except merely causally.12
Brandom is encouraged in this by the fact that he cannot see room for any
internalism about observational knowledge, since the only interpretation for
such an internalism that he considers will not cohere with the fact that
observational knowledge is non–inferential.
Sorting out the role of experience in Sellars’s account of observational
knowledge is a project for a different occasion. But I hope I have said enough
to indicate why, if we appreciate Sellars’s complex picture of the relations that
constitute the space of reasons, that helps to bring out that there is room in
Sellars’s picture for experience to play a more than merely causal role in a
fully internalist epistemology of observation.
