Sellars on Thought and Language*
AUSONIO MARRAS
UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN ONTARIO
I
According to a venerable philosophical tradition, the concepts
of speech and thought are, in some important sense, analogically
related. The analogy can be illustrated in a variety of ways. For
example, both speech and thought may be said to refer to, or be
about, something or other. Both speech and thought are reportable
by means of indirect speech constructions. What I judge, as well
as what I say, may be said to be true or false, interesting or uninteresting, justified or unjustified, etc. And, in general, whatever
principles of reasoning or intelligent conjecturing and calculating
seem to govern verbal activity also seem to govern mental
activity.
To describe in more detail the analogy between speech and
thought would not be as arduous a task as to explain the apparently
remarkable fact that such an analogy should exist at all. This latter
task, in effect, is what Wilfrid Sellars has undertaken in several
of his works, but in most succinct form in his classical essay
"Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind" ([5], 177-189). Essentially, Sellars attempts to explain the analogy by giving us a
theory in which the concept of a meaningful verbal episode is
taken as primitive, and the concept of a mental episode is characterized as an analogical extension of the concept of a verbal
episode.
In this respect, Sellars' theory seems to contradict the
"traditional view", which goes back to the medievals, according
to which semantical talk (talk by which verbal episodes are characterized as meaningful, true, false, etc.) is covertly psychological,
in the sense that it involves an implicit reference to mental
episodes which are, in a primary sense, intentional. (A similar
view is held in the present time by R. M. Chisholm; see [1], 523.)
For according to Sellars' theory, it is only "because of" the
semantical properties of verbal episodes that mental episodes can

be said to have the intentional properties they have. Thoughts
are indeed intentional, and necessarily so ([1], 536), but it is meaningful speech, according to Sellars, that is the source of their
intentionality.
In the course of defending this claim, Sellars constructs a
fable about our linguistic ancestors whose point, in nuce, is to show
how mentalistic discourse is in principle reconstructible from
semantical discourse with the help of certain other linguistic
resources. Let us briefly review the main points of this well-known
fable (referred to by Sellars as the "Jonesean myth").
We are invited to imagine a stage in prehistory in which
humans are limited to a primitive Rylean language of public objects,
rich enough to permit all standard logical operations as well as
the framing of subjunctive-conditional propositions. Given such
a language, Sellars' claim is that the addition to it of the conceptual
resources of semantical and theoretical discourse would be sufficient
to enable the users of the language to come to acquire the concept
of a mental episode as we now have it. Semantical discourse would
enable our mythical speakers to characterize verbal episodes in
semantical terms and therefore to ascribe to these episodes
characteristics analogous to the intentional characteristics we now
ascribe to mental episodes. And with the addition of theoretical
discourse our mythical speakers are enabled to envisage a new
kind of episode, namely mental episodes, which are like verbal
episodes in being conceived as being about something, but which
are not verbal episodes. The theoretical motivation for postulating
such new entities is the remarkable fact that people seem capable
of certain forms of intelligent behaviour even when no detectable
verbal productions accompany such behaviour. To account for
this remarkable fact, Sellars' mythical speakers (or rather a genius
by the name of "Jones"), develop a theory to the effect that "overt
verbal behaviour is the culmination of a process which begins with
'inner speech' " ([5], 186).
So much for Sellars' fable. The fact that in this fable mental
episodes are postulated as theoretical entities on the model of
overt episodes should clarify Sellars' claim about the conceptual
primacy of language-the claim, that is, that the intentionality
of thought is to be explained by reference to the categories of
semantical discourse, and not the other way around, as the traditional view wanted it. Sellars can make his claim, of course, because
the model he uses in constructing the concept of thought is itself
an essentially semantical model.

Despite this point of conflict with the traditional view,
Sellars' theory enables us to give a qualified endorsement to the
traditional claim about the primacy of thought. For if indeed,
according to Sellars' theory, verbal episodes are the culmination,
or causal manifestation, of thoughts, then without thoughts meaningful verbal episodes (as distinct from mere marks and noises)
would simply not exist. Thus verbal episodes are what they are
(have the semantical properties they have) because (in a causal
sense of the word) of the occurrence of inner episodes which,
being what they are (according to Jones' theory), have the properties of intentionality. However, Sellars' claim is that although
thought is causally and therefore existentially prior to speech,
speech is conceptually (that is, in the order of rational reconstruction)
prior to thought (cf. [8], 163-164). To state Sellars' position somewhat aphoristically, we could say that "in the order of being"
it is correct to say that speech is thought-out-loud, whereas "in
the order of conceiving" it is correct to say that thought is silent
speech.
II
It is clear from the foregoing that if Sellars' theory is sound,
it must be possible for someone to acquire an adequate concept
of meaningful speech prior to acquiring the concept of a thought.
For if Sellars wishes to introduce the theoretical framework of
thoughts on the basis of a semantical conception of linguistic
behaviour, then, in his own words, "it must be possible to have
[an adequate'] conception pertaining to linguistic behaviour
which ... is genuinely independent of concepts pertaining to
mental acts. . . . Otherwise the supposed 'introduction' of the
framework would be a sham" ([8], 71).
The crucial question (which, in terms of the Jonesean myth,
is a question about the very first stage of the linguistic development
of our Rylean ancestors) then is: Is it possible, as Sellars claims
it is, to have an adequate conception of the semantical characteristics of language prior to having a conception of thoughts and
their intentional characteristics ? Or, if it is possible, has Sellars
shown that it is ?
We may approach this question by examining Sellars' account
of what it is to say of an utterance, e.g. 'S', that it means something,
e.g. that p. Sellars repeatedly warns us that the semantical rubric
' "S" (in L) means p' is not to be understood as expressing a

SELLARS ON THOUGHT AND LANGUAGE 155
relation between a linguistic entity and a non-linguistic entity
(proposition, thought, fact, etc.), but is to be understood, instead,
as a classificatory statement to the effect that the utterance 'S'
(in L) belongs to the class of those utterances in any language
that play the role played in the speaker's language by the sentence
abbreviated by 'p'. Thus, for Sellars, ' "S" (in L) means p' is
tantamount to ' "S" (in L) is a -p', where ' p ' is a "common
noun which applies to items in any language that play the role
played in our language by the sign-design that occurs between the
dot-quotes" ([7], 658).
Leaving details and possible quibbles aside, what emerges
from this account is that an utterance's being meaningful
("nonparroting") is understood in terms of its playing a role in a
language, and that therefore a characterization of the semantical
properties of the utterance requires a specification of this role.
Furthermore, by "role in a language" Sellars means "role in the
(verbal and nonverbal) behaviour of the users of the language".
Thus, Sellars speaks of "meaningful overt speech" as speech
"understood in terms of the uniformities and propensities which
connect utterances with (1) other utterances (at the same or
different levels of language), (2) with the perceptible environment,
and (3) with courses of action (including linguistic behaviour)"
([7], 310; also [1], 530).
There are now two crucial points to be noted. (1) The role
played by meaningful verbal episodes is a purely Rylean role. As
Sellars put it, "Dot quote common nouns [which classify the role
played by an expression in a language] have a purely Rylean sense"
([8], 161; also [1], 530). Therefore, the fundamentum of Sellars'
semantics is Rylean behaviourism. However, Sellars warns us, this
is not to say that semantical discourse is analyzable in terms of
Rylean concepts; for, he claims, semantical statements "imply
[presumably nonanalytically] but do not assert certain Rylean
facts", in the sense that, although semantical statements would
not be true unless certain Rylean facts obtained (such facts being
therefore behavioural criteria for the truth of semantical statements), the semantical statements are not "reconstructible out of
Rylean resources" ([1], 530; cf. [5], 178-79). Why not? The
reason, I think, is that if semantical discourse is indeed to be
understood in terms of Rylean facts, that is, in terms of "uniformities and propensities" describable by subjunctive-conditional
sentences correlating the causes and effects of verbal episodes
([5], 178), then these uniformities "are not mere uniformities,

156 NOUS
for they are grounded in rules in a way most difficult to analyze,
but which involves the causal efficacy of rule expressions" ([7],
65). And this takes us to the second point.
(2) The concept of playing a role is essentially a normative
concept, for it is only by being rule-governed that something can
be said to be a role-player. (". . . the concept of an -fa- ultimately
involves (as does the concept of a pawn) the concept of what it is
to satisfy a norm or a standard . . ." ([7], 664).) Thus, it is clear
that if we wish to understand what it is for a linguistic item to play
a role, we must first clarify what it is for it to be rule-governed.
Since to use a language is in relevant respects analogous to
playing a game, Sellars observes that a meaningful utterance (a
role playing episode) is like a move in a game, and like moves in
a game it falls under a system of rules. Now it is clear that an
utterance's being meaningful ("nonparroting") must involve
something more than its merely conforming to the rules of the language-game. What can this something more be? Can it be
obedience of the rules? If obeying the rules requires either (i)
having the rules in mind and being able to apply them in the
appropriate circumstances, or (ii) being aware of a "structure of
demands" and "intend their realization", then Sellars denies that
playing a language game must (though sometimes it may) involve
obeying the rules ([6], 321-324).
What then is the alternative? Sellars gives us his answer
by distinguishing a type of behaviour, which he calls "pattern
governed behaviour", which is neither an instance of merely ruleconforming behaviour nor yet of rule-obeying behaviour. By way
of explanation, we are told that to play a game at the level of
pattern governed behaviour is to perform certain acts "because
of a system of moves to which these acts belong" ([6], 327). Sellars
illustrates what he means by this by using as an example the
"dance" of the bees. The example is supposed to illustrate a type
of behaviour whose conformity to a complex system of acts is both
unintentional (in the sense that the agent need not "envisage the
system" nor "intend its realization") and yet not accidental (in
a sense of 'accidental' to be contrasted with 'necessary').
But the trouble is that these characteristics of pattern governed
behaviour seem to belong to rule-conforming behaviour as well:
the latter is surely unintended (in the sense explained), and if it
is truly rule-conforming, it cannot be really accidental (chancy ?)
but must exhibit some nomological characteristics, whether these
be innate (instinctive) or acquired (as a result of conditioning).2

SELLARS ON THOUGHT AND LANGUAGE 157
The resemblance between pattern-governed and rule-conforming
behaviour appears even more striking when we are told that "to
learn pattern-governed behaviour is to become conditioned to
arrange perceptible elements into patterns and to form these, in
turn, into more complex patterns and sequences of patterns"
([6], 327). And the conditioning envisaged here is, for Sellars,
capable of explanation in S-R reinforcement terms.
Now in view of recent results in psycholinguistic research,3
one might have serious misgivings about using this type of
behaviour as the model for understanding the type of intelligent
behaviour involved in speaking a language, as Sellars says, "nonparrotingly". But quite aside from this consideration, it seems to
me that to the extent that pattern governed behaviour is assimilated
to (however complex) a system of uniformities in behavioural
responses, it must fail to fulfill the semantical function for which
it was intended. For recall Sellars' claim that meaningful speech
is to be understood in terms of (Rylean) "uniformities and propensities"; and recall his suggestive qualification of this claim that
these uniformities and propensities are not mere uniformities and
propensities, for "they are grounded in rules in a way most difficult
to analyze, but which involves the causal efficacy of rule expressions" ([7], 657). It was in order to get clear on the sense
exactly in which these uniformities and propensities are "grounded
in rules" that we turned to Sellars' account of language-games
and rule-governed behaviour in general. It would therefore be
disappointing to discover in the end that the uniformities and
propensities that are involved in pattern governed behaviour
(Sellars' model for understanding meaningful speech) are nothing
more than a matter of more or less complex patterns of behavioural
uniformities in which, as far as Sellars has been able to show, rules
really play no active role (have no "causal efficacy"); for, on Sellars'
account, it is only at the level of rule-obeying behaviour that the
rules themselves are "engaged in the genesis of the moves" ([6], 341).4
It would seem, therefore, given the requirements of Sellars'
semantical theory (that is, given the causal role to be played by
rules), that pattern governed behaviour should be assimilated not
so much to rule-conforming behaviour as rather to rule-obeying
behaviour. Of course, Sellars' claim is that pattern governed
behaviour is a distinct form of behaviour, no more to be assimilated
to rule-conforming than to rule-obeying behaviour. But it is
precisely this claim that it is not clear Sellars has succeeded in
substantiating.

I shall not, however, press this point, as I do not attach to
it as much importance as Sellars apparently does. For even if
Sellars were able to specify a form of behaviour (namely pattern
governed behaviour) which is neither a form of merely ruleconforming behaviour nor yet a form of rule-obeying behaviour,
the crucial question would still remain whether it is possible to
have a concept (or an understanding) of pattern governed behaviour
independently of having a concept of rule-obeying behaviour.
(Compare: although there are sons who are not themselves parents,
it does not follow that the concept of being a son can be understand
independently of the concept of being a parent.) The reason why
this is a crucial question vis-a-vis the methodological requirements
of Sellars' theoretical account of the mental is that the "Jonesean"
acquisition of the resources of semantical discourse must be
regarded at least in part as an acquisition of the semantical concept
of what it is for a linguistic item to be a role-player and, therefore
(for Sellars), of what it is for it to be an item of pattern governed
behaviour. And if having a concept of pattern governed behaviour
should require also having a concept of rule-obeying behaviour,
then it would be possible to formulate a very serious objection
against Sellars' methodological programme-an objection which
would apply even if Sellars had succeeded in specifying a type of
behaviour, namely pattern governed behaviour, which is distinct
both from rule-conforming behaviour as well as from rule-obeying
behaviour.
The objection can be put as follows: Although to play a
(language) game at the pattern-governed level need not imply
obeying the rules, to have the semantical ability to characterize
an item of lingustic behaviour in semantical terms, as e.g. an
instance of pattern governed behaviour, involves having a concept
of what it is to obey a rule. But the latter concept, on Sellars'
own account, implies such further concepts as being aware of the
rules (or at least, of the moves demanded and permitted by the
game) as well as being willing to play the game by the rules. But
then it appears that an explanation of the use of semantical discourse
implies the possession, on the part of the user, of intentional
or psychological concepts. How then can psychological
discourse be regarded as an analogical extension of semantical
discourse ?

SELLARS ON THOUGHT AND LANGUAGE 159
III
There are various ways in which Sellars might attempt to
circumvent this objection. He might claim that at least one of the
following three claims is false:
(1) To have the ability to use semantical discourse requires
having the concept of rule-obeying behaviour.
(2) The concept of rule-obeying behaviour entails psychological concepts.
(3) The psychological concepts entailed by rule-obeying
behaviour are of the same kind as those postulated by
Jones' theory.
I shall consider each of these claims in the same order.
(i) We have seen that for Sellars to be able to characterize
items of verbal behaviour in semantical terms (e.g. to be able
to say of them that "they mean thus and so, ... that they are
true, false etc." is not simply to be able to talk about them as
"causes and effects", or as "indicators" of other items of verbal
and nonverbal behaviour ([5], 179). Instead, to say, for example,
that the statement 'Snow is white' is true is to say that it is
"assertible in accordance with the relevant semantical rules";
that is, it is to say that the "assertion of the right-hand side of the
implication statement [" 'Snow is white' is true -*Snow is white"]
is a performance of the kind authorized by the truth statement on
the left" ([8], 101).
But then it appears that if one (such as Jones) is to be in a
position to say, e.g., that a given statement is true, that is, assertible,
in accordance with the relevant semantical rules, he must be able
to realize that there are rules (whether he can actually formulate
them or not) which authorize the assertion of the statement. He
must realize this if he realizes that the assertion of the proposition
is a "move" which is demanded or permitted in the sort of circumstances in which the assertion was made. Thus, to criticise
a piece of verbal behaviour in semantical terms is, as Sellars has
put it, to ask whether it "involves 'positions' and 'moves' that
would be specified by 'formation' and 'transformation' rules in
its metagame if it were rule obeying behaviour" ([5], 327). Hence,
the user of semantical discourse must have a conception of what it
is to obey the rules-whether or not in using semantical discourse
in a given instance he does in fact obey rules.

It may seem that Sellars can avoid this last consequence by
distinguishing, as he has done most clearly in [9],5 between two
kinds of rules: rules of criticism ("ought-to-be's") on the one hand,
and rules of action ("ought-to-do's") on the other. The point of
the distinction is that the subjects to which ought-to-be's apply
need not have a conception of the rules or of the circumstances in
which the rules apply, whereas the subjects of the ought-to-do's
do require these conceptual abilities. Ought-to-be's would thus
seem to be the sort of rules that are relevant for explaining pattern
governed behaviour, and ought-to-do's would be the sorts of rules
that are relevant for explaining rule-obeying behaviour. Thus,
in semantically characterizing an item of linguistic behaviour as
an instance of pattern governed behaviour, one, it would seem,
need only be cognizant of the ought-to-be rules that govern this
type of behaviour, and not also of the ought-to-do's which are
operative in rule-obeying behaviour.
This distinction, however, is of little avail to Sellars in the
present context, because, as we are told, "ought-to-be's and oughtto-do's are conceptually inseparable" ([9], 551), as "ought-to-be's
imply ought-to-do's" ([9], 508). Thus, it appears, to have the
concept of ought-to-be's requires having the concept of ought-todo's. To be sure, one may grant that the subjects to which oughtto-be's apply need not themselves have any conception of rules
(of whatever kind) or of the circumstances in which they apply,
without thereby granting that a semanticist's (Jones') understanding of ought-to-be's (required for understanding pattern
governed behaviour) does not presuppose an understanding of
ought-to-do's and therefore of what it would be to obey rules.
Indeed, given the conceptual connection between the two kinds
of rules, it seems necessary that to be able to use semantical
discourse to characterize meaningful speech even at the level
of pattern governed behaviour requires having the concept of
ought-to-do's and thus of rule-obeying behaviour.
(ii) That Sellars' account of rule-obeying behaviour requires
psychological concepts should already be clear from the characterization given of it on p. 156 above. Rule-obeying behaviour
is characterized by the fact that obeying rules involves "doing A
in C, A' in C', etc. with the intention of fulfilling the demands of
an envisaged system of rules" ([6], 325, my italics). The concept
of rule-obeying behaviour and the ought-to-do's governing it
fall under the concept of action (in the sense of something which
one can decide'to do); and for agents to perform an action A in
This content downloaded from 62.122.79.21 on Mon, 16 Jun 2014 02:58:56 AM

SELLARS ON THOUGHT AND LANGUAGE 161
circumstance C is, according to Sellars, "a matter of their setting
about doing A when they believe that the circumstances are C"
([9], 507-508).6
Moreover, when Sellars says that in playing a game as an
instance of rule-obeying behaviour "the rules themselves are
engaged in the genesis of the moves" ([6], 341), the obvious way
to understand this "causal efficacy" of the rules is to suppose that
a conception or awareness of the rules on the part of the agent
plays a causal role in the genesis of the moves. Only in concipi,
not merely in esse, can a rule or any other proposition be said to be
causally active.
(iii) The denial of (3) is, I suspect, the course that Sellars
would be most inclined to follow. While granting that the ability to
use semantical discourse implies "awarenesses" of the sort described
above, Sellars might ask: why construe these awarenesses as inner
psychological episodes and not, say, as pre-J7onesean or Rylean
psychological episodes or dispositions-as, that is, actual or
potential recognizings-out-loud, noticings-out-loud, intendingsout-loud, etc. ? (Cf. [8], 75-76, and especially [4], where the
distinction between pre-Jonesean and post-Jonesean psychological
statements is explicitly made for the first time by Sellars.) No
methodological problem would arise for Sellars if the awarenesses
involved in the ability to use semantical discourse are construed
in this latter way.
However, the problem with construing these awarenesses
a' la Ryle is, I suspect, that we are led to a vicious circle on either
of what appear to be the only two possible interpretations of these
Rylean awarenesses. Let us see why.
It is clear in the first place that in so far as these Rylean
awarenesses, as bona fide overt role-playing episodes, play semantical roles, they cannot merely be viewed as (overt) episodes caught
up in a system of "uniformities and propensities"; for, as we have
seen, merely to say of an item that it is caught up in a system of
uniformities and propensities is only to talk about it in terms of
its causes and effects, or of its empirical correlations with other
(linguistic or nonlinguistic) items. And, as we have seen, to talk
about an item in terms of its causal configurations is not to characterize it in semantical terms unless we explain that these causal
configurations exist in an "ambience of (semantical) rules".
Now these semantical rules, in turn, may be involved in
these configurations either at the level of pattern governed behaviour (as ought-to-be rules) or at the higher level of rule-obeying

behaviour (as ought-to-do rules). The latter alternative leads to
a vicious circle, for we are trying to explain rule-obeying behaviour
in terms of Rylean awarenesses of rules, and therefore we cannot
explain the latter in terms of rule-obeying behaviour. The former
alternative, in so far as it identifies a Rylean awareness with an
item of pattern governed behaviour (a verbal response), also leads
to a vicious circle. For it was in order to explain what is involved
in the semantical ability to characterize an item of linguistic
behaviour as a pattern-governed response that the concept of
rule-obeying behaviour and therefore of awareness of rules was
invoked in the first place.
If, then, the awarenesses entailed by rule-obeying behaviour
and thus by the ability to use semantical discourse cannot be
merely Rylean uniformities and propensities, what else can they
be ? I know of no other plausible alternative but to regard these
awarenesses as ordinary (for Sellars: post-Jonesean) inner occurrences or propensities, conceived, with respect to their formal
characteristics, as essentially intentional phenomena, in a primary
sense of these words. But if this is so, Sellars' analogical account
of mental episodes is rendered methodologically unintelligible.

SELLARS ON THOUGHT AND LANGUAGE 163
NOTES
* I had the benefit of discussing an earlier draft of this paper with W. Harper
and C. A. Hooker. Their disagreement with much of the critical part of this paper
provided a useful stimulus for a more careful formulation of my criticism.
1 This qualification is necessary because according to Sellars a "full blooded"
(i.e. post-Jonesean) conception of linguistic behaviour would of course involve the
concept of thoughts: for, on Jones' theory, intelligent linguistic behaviour is the
causal manifestation of thoughts.
2 There is a sense in which genuine (as against mock) "parroting talk" is,
in principle, just as much subject to laws (however complex these may be) as any
other form of physical behaviour. Indeed, in this sense is there anything (outside,
perhaps, the sphere of the intentional) which is truly accidental?
3 I have in mind, primarily, the work of Noam Chomsky and his associates.
Of great interest are also some unorthodox developments within behaviouristic
psychology itself; see, e.g., Spielberger [10] and Dulany [2].
4 This, at least, seems to be a distinguishing characteristic of rule-obeying
behaviour as against pattern-governed behaviour. Sellars says: ". . . we have
emphasized that in an object game played as rule-obeying behaviour, not only
do the moves exemplify positions specified by the rules (for this is also true of mere
pattern governed behaviour where even though a rule exists the playing organism
has not learned to play it) but also the rules themselves are engaged in the genesis
of the moves. The moves occur (in part, in a sense demanding analysis) because
of the rules" ([6], 341).
5 A detailed discussion of Sellars' account of rules in [9] may be found in my
paper [3]. See also Sellars' reply to my paper in the same journal.
6 In [5], Sellars goes so far as to suggest that following the rules in any sense
short of merely conforming to the rules (exhibiting a uniformity) involves
psychological concepts: ". . . if the expression 'following a rule' is taken seriously,
and is not weakened beyond all recognition into the bare notion of exhibiting
a uniformity-in which case the lightning-thunder sequence would 'follow a
rule'-then it is the knowledge or belief that the circumstances are of a certain kind,
and not the mere fact that they are of this kind, which contributes to bringing about
the action" ([5], 166; first two italics are mine).
