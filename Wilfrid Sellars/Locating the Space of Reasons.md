 Locating the Space of Reasons
 Jennifer Church
 Resumen
 McDowell da una explicación singular del llamado "espacio de las razones": de-
 fiende que al menos algunos hechos acerca del mundo externo se hallan en el "inter-
 ior" de ese "espacio". Sin embargo, este enfoque se enfrenta a una dificultad, al trazar
 una línea entre lo que se halla dentro del espacio de las razones y lo que se encuentra
 fuera del espacio de las razones. La dificultad podría mitigarse si los objetos de la per-
 cepción pudieran pertenecer tanto al espacio de las razones como a lo que McDowell
 denomina el "ámbito de la ley".
 Abstract
 McDowell offers a distinctive understanding of the so-called "space of re sons"; he maintains that at least some facts about the external world belong "with this "space". His approach encounters a certain difficulty, however, in drawing a  between what belongs within the space of reasons and what lies outside of the sp of reasons. The difficulty might be alleviated if the objects of perception could belo to both the space of reasons and to what McDowell calls the "realm of law".
 Sellars' evocative notion of a "space of reasons" has been regularly in- voked over the last decade or so - most centrally, perhaps, in the work of John McDowell. The basic metaphor is clear enough: the space of reasons i a "space" which "contains" things that can enter into rational or justificator relations (things that are capable or providing reasons or justifications and/ things for which reasons or justifications can be provided), and it is a "spac whose "contours" are determined by the many intersecting "paths" that jus fication may take (with different justifications emerging from or converg on the same point, with more or less direct ways to justify one thing by a peal to another, and so on). What is less clear, and more in dispute, is just what entities can stand in justificatory relations and just how justificatory  lations are related to other sorts of relations between things in the world These are questions about what belongs "inside" versus "outside" the sp of reasons, and questions about how the space of reasons is related to vari other "spaces". I begin by noting McDowell's distinctive understanding the space of reasons, and his arguments in favor of this understanding. I th highlight some tensions that arise in his work - in particular, tensions th 85

 Sellars introduces the notion of a space of reasons in the context of his
 discussion of observational reports such as "This is green." Such a report can
 only express a state of knowledge, he argues, if the speaker is able to justify
 the report by appeal to some further, and more general, knowledge about the
 reliability of such reports.
 The essential point is that in characterizing an episode or a state as that of
 knowing , we are not giving an empirical description of that episode or state; we
 are placing it in the logical space of reasons, of justifying and being able to jus-
 tify what one says [Sellars (1956), §36].
 Sellars here makes a distinction between two different ways of charac-
 terizing an episode or a state - a way that indicates its empirical properties,
 and a way that indicates its availability for justification. An utterance of the
 sentence "This is green", for example, may be described as a sequence of
 sounds resulting from a series of bodily changes or it may be described as an
 expression of knowledge. The first characterization places it within the em-
 pirical world while the second "places" it within the "world" of justification
 - i.e. the space of reasons.
 Brandom's explication of Sellars's notion of a space of reasons extends
 the relevant characterizations beyond the laudatory category of "knowing".
 [Sellars] could as well have said that in characterizing an episode or state as one
 of believing , or applying concepts , or grasping propositional contents we are
 not giving an empirical description. . . but placing it in the logical space of rea-
 sons... [Brandom (1997), p. 160].
 Brandom's point is that in the very act of employing concepts, we open
 ourselves to questions of justification and thereby enter into the normative
 space of reasons. Observational reports such as "This is green" belong to the
 space of reasons not merely because we regard them as expressions of knowl-
 edge but, more fundamentally, because using concepts to make claims {versus
 merely uttering words) depends on having the ability to make appropriate in-
 ferences to and from those claims.

 [W]hat distinguishes concept-using creatures from way around the space of reasons. Grasping or un being able practically to place it in a network of  what is evidence for or against its being properl and what its proper applicability to a particular  against [Brandom (2001), p. 82].
 The suggestion - quite accurate, I think - is t nize how one claim may be appropriately used to nologically like our capacity to recognize appropr in space.
 McDowell extends the notion of a space of reasons still further, to en-
 compass not only intentional states of all sorts but the very contents of those
 states - the facts that we perceive and come to believe. Perception, accord-
 ing to McDowell, is not an active process of conceptualizing input from a
 world that stands outside of the space of reasons; rather, it is a receptivity to a
 world that is already conceptual and already within the space of reasons.
 That things are thus and so is the content of the experience, and it can also be
 the content of a judgment ... So it is conceptual content. But that things are
 thus and so is also, if one is not misled, an aspect of the layout of the world: it
 is how things are. Thus the idea of conceptually structured operations of recep-
 tivity puts us in a position to speak of experience as openness to the layout of
 reality. Experience enables the layout of reality itself to exert a rational influ-
 ence on what a subject thinks [McDowell (1994), p. 26].
 Note that, as McDowell understands it, it is not our recognition that we
 are presented with a fact that gives us a reason to believe. The relation is more
 direct: in being presented with a fact, we are presented with a reason to be-
 lieve - whether or not we acknowledge it as such.1 There are reasons that
 are not registered as such precisely because there are facts that are not regis-
 tered as such. Thus McDowell adheres to something of a pre-modern sensi-
 bility in which reasons do not inhabit our minds so much as our minds inhabit
 a world of reasons. We do not construct reasons for belief or action, we dis-
 cover them (and we do not discover them within ourselves , we discover them
 in the world around us).
 Consider how McDowell arrives at this expanded understanding of the
 space of reasons. He begins Mind and World by endorsing Kant's famous
 statement that "thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without con-
 cepts are blind" [Kant (1787), A51/B75]. But he argues for this double-sided
 claim in a rather unKantian way, and his targets are not eighteenth century phi-
 losophers Hume and Leibniz so much as twentieth century philosophers Quine
 and Davidson. Quine is accused of relying on unconceptualized intuitions
 (his "tribunal of experience") to legitimate our web of belief, overlooking the

 regions and aspects, in a way that depends on the the world [McDowell (1994), p. 56].
 Various objections have been raised again perceptual content. Many commentators have ar tents are simply too thin to count as conceptual  many have worried that McDowell's account fails that is shared by perception and misperception a bent on such critics to demonstrate that these drawbacks are more serious than
 the drawbacks of the two alternatives McDowell is maneuvering between, or to
 show that there is still another alternative to be had.) If we follow McDowell's
 lead, however, we are returned to a world of reasons that are already "out
 there" to be discovered. We simply open our "eyes" to find conceptualized con-
 tents in the world around us, and those conceptualized contents give us reason
 to believe what we do. In seeing a flame, for example, we see something out-
 side of ourselves that justifies our belief in the presence of a flame; the flame
 appears as something independent of us and its appearing - which is equally
 our perceiving - provides a reason (not just a cause) for our belief.3 By em-
 bracing this picture of things, we regain something of the "innocence" of the
 ancients, freed from the need to engage in the sort of "constructive" philoso-
 phy that (fruitlessly) aims to refute the skeptic. (The project of restoring such
 "innocence" by dissolving the need to respond to the skeptic is a project in
 which McDowell is more closely aligned with Wittgenstein than with Kant
 - though he differs from both in seeking to restore an ancient innocence
 about values as well.)
 II
 If the contents of perception are independent facts in the world, and if
 these facts already have a conceptual structure such that they are able to place
 rational constraints on belief, then nothing that is perceivable will fall "outside"
 the space of reasons. But, at least on the face of it, the facts that we perceive
 also belong to the realm of natural law, and McDowell, like Sellars, wants to
 draw a sharp distinction between the space of reasons and the realm of law.
 [W]e can say that the way our lives are shaped by reason is natural, even while
 we deny that the structure of the space of reasons can be integrated into the lay-
 out of the realm of law [McDowell (1994), pp. 88-9].
 Sellars, it will be recalled, distinguished between empirical characteri-
 zations of episodes or states and normative characterizations of those same
 episodes or states; the very same state can be characterized in two different

 I quote this passage at length flection on one's beliefs and actions underwrites a kind of freedom for both
 understanding and morality. McDowell is not conflating Kant's account of
 the understanding and his account of morality so much as highlighting their
 common reliance on the free-play of reflection.
 If this is right, then it is our capacity for reflection that enables us to
 move beyond informed responses to the world (the sort of responses that
 other animals make as well) to the making of judgments about the world and
 judgments about ourselves. "Second nature" is not just ethical nature, it is re-
 flective nature, and reflective nature is what enables us to recognize both the
 independence of the world we perceive and its capacity to provide us with
 reasons for our beliefs and actions.
 [W]e arrive at the notion of having one's eyes opened to reasons at large by ac-
 quiring a second nature [McDowell (1994), p. 84].
 By McDowell's own lights, this independent reason-giving world in-
 cludes both the fact that a flame is growing and the fact that hurting someone
 is wrong - both of which are normative in the sense that both warrant the
 acquisition of some beliefs rather than others, and the performance of some
 actions rather than others.
 The ethical is a domain of rational requirements, which are there in any case,
 whether or not we are responsive to them. We are alerted to these demands by
 acquiring appropriate conceptual capacities. When a decent upbringing initiates
 us into the relevant way of thinking, our eyes are opened to the very existence
 of this tract o/the space of reasons [McDowell (1994), p. 82 (my italics)].
 Ethical facts, then, are just one part of the space of reasons; physical
 facts are another.
 My worry, then, is not that of Friedman, who fears that too much is be-
 ing assimilated within the space of reasons. I worry, rather, that the sharp di-
 vide between the realm of law and the space of reasons begins to break down
 once we realize that certain facts - the facts that form the contents of many
 ordinary perceptions - must belong in both domains.
 Ill
 I have been urging that, on McDowell's view, everything that we can
 perceive must exists within the space of reasons - because everything that we
 can perceive can serve as a reason for our beliefs and actions. But that does
 not mean that everything that we perceive must stand in rational relations to

 Notes
 1 In replying to Barry Stroud (2002), for example, McDowell writes "I think we
 need an attitude of perception as something in which there is no attitude of acceptance
 or endorsement at all, but only, as I put it, an invitation to adopt such an attitude, which,
 in the best of cases, consists in a fact's making itself manifest to one" [McDowell
 (2002a), p. 278].
 Not everyone agree with this argument, of course. It was criticized by Jerry
 Fodor (1995) in his early review of Mind and World and it has been criticized more
 recently, at greater length, by Richard Heck (2000).
 There is no need to first ascertain the reliability of such appearings. McDowell
 (2002a) defends this position against what he sees as Brandom' s misleading appro-
 priation (or, perhaps, Sellarsation) of his ideas.
 McDowell's rejection of Davidson's ontological claim - i.e. his monism - is
 discussed most explicitly in McDowell (1998a), esp. pp. 339-40; more briefly in
 McDowell (1994), pp. 74-6.
 5 Animals are said to exist in an environment, not in a world (which is also a
 space of reasons), while we, as rational animals, exist in both. But this suggests that
 what we come to know through perception - e.g. that this flame is growing - is some-
 thing different than what animals come to know through perception. McDowell elabo-
 rates on his view of animal knowledge in McDowell (2002b).
