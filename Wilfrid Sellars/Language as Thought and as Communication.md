LANGUAGE AS THOUGHT AND AS COMMUNICATION
WILFRID SELLARS
My aim in this paper is to throw light from several directions on the
intimate connections which exist between conceptual thinking and the
linguistic behavior which is said to 'express' it. The position which I
shall ultimately delineate and defend, though behavioristic in its methodological orientation is not, initial appearances to the contrary, behavioristic
in its substantive contentions. It can, nevertheless, be characterized as
an attempt to give a naturalistic interpretation of the intentionality of
conceptual acts.
The early sections (I-IV) stress the essentially rule-governed character
of linguistic behavior. I argue that a proper understanding of the nature
and status of linguistic rules is a sine qua non of a correct interpretation
of the sense in which linguistic behavior can be said to be (and not
merely to express) conceptual activity. The second, and larger part of
the paper (Sections Vff.) is devoted to exploring the sense (or senses)
in which language can be said to 'express' thought. A distinction is
drawn between three different contexts in which the verb occurs. It is
argued that they involve radically different meanings which, if confused,
blur the distinction between language as conceptual act and language as
means of communication, and preclude the possibility of an adequate
philosophy of language.
I
There are many interesting questions about the exact meaning or
meanings of the term 'rule' in non-philosophical contexts. What, for
example, is the difference between a 'rule' and a 'principle'? Are principles simple 'first' rules in that they are not special applications of more
general rules? Or is the primary difference that rules can be arbitrary?
Or are principles rules for choosing rules? Is the principle of induction,
for example, a higher order rule for choosing law-like statements, themselves construed as extra-logical rules of inference? Though these ques506 
LANGUAGE AS THOUGHT AND AS COMMUNICATION 507
tions are intrinsically interesting and relevant to the general topic of this
paper, I shall not discuss them. For however the domain of norms and
standards is to be stratified and botanized, the term 'rule' has acquired
over the years a technical and generic sense in which it applies to general
statements concerning that which ought or ought not to be done or to
be the case, or to be permissible or not permissible -. distinctions which
can be put in many different ways.
For our purposes, then, a rule is roughly a general 'ought' statement.
Such statements have been traditionally divided into hypothetical and
categorical 'oughts,' or, as it has often misleadingly been put, 'imperatives.' The distinction between hypothetical and categorical oughts is an
important one, though I believe that they are far more intimately related
than is ordinarily taken to be the case.'
Hypothetical oughts have the form "if one wants X, one ought to
do Y." They transpose a relation of implication between a state of
affairs X and a doing of Y into an implication appropriate to practical
reasoning. In spite of their crucial importance to a theory of normative
discourse, I shall have nothing to say about them, save by implication.
As far as anything I have so far said is concerned, a categorical
ought is simply one that is not, in the familiar Kantian sense, a hypothetical ought. I shall continue my division informally by calling attention to the most familiar variety of general categorical oughts, those,
namely, of the form
If one is in C, one ought to do A.
Notice that although this proposition is conditional in form, it is not,
in the Kantian sense, a hypothetical ought; and it is as contrasted with
the latter that, even though it is conditional, it is called categorical. By
application and the use of modus ponens one can derive conclusions of
the form
S ought to do A
which not only are not hypothetical oughts, but are categorical (non-iffy)
statements. Notice, by contrast, that from "If one wants X, one ought
to do A," together with "S wants X" it is not correct to infer "S ought
to do A."
The important feature, for our purposes, of general categorical oughts
of the above form is that for actual existence to conform to these oughts
is a matter of the agents to which they apply doing A when they are
actually in the specified circumstance C; and this, in turn, a matter of
1 For an exploration of this and related issues, see my Science and Metaphysics
(London, Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1968), Chapter VI (especially sections
XIV-XVII). 
508 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH
their setting about doing A when they believe that the circumstances
are C.
It follows that the 'subjects' to which these rules apply must have the
concepts of doing A and being in C. They must have, to use a current
tum of phrase, the appropriate 'recognitional capacities.' Furthermore,
for the rule itself to play a role in bringing about the conformity of
'is' to 'ought,' the agents in question must conceive of actions A as what
ought to be done in circumstances C. This requires that they have the
concept of what it is for an action to be called for by a certain kind
of circumstance.
II
Importantly different from rules of the above form - which may be
called, in a straightforward sense, rules of action - are rules that specify
not what someone ought to do, but how something ought to be. Of these
an important sub class has the form.
Xs ought to be in state cp, whenever such and such is the case
The purpose of such a rule is achieved to the extent that it comes to
be the case that Xs are in state p when such and such is indeed the
case. This time, however, the conformity of actual existence to the ought
does not, in general, require that the Xs which are, in a sense, the subjects of the rule, i.e. that to which it applies, have the concept of what
it is to be in state p or of what it is for such and such to be the case.
This is obvious when the Xs in question are inanimate objects, as in
the example.
Clock chimes ought to strike on the quarter hour.
Now ought-to-be's (or rules of criticism as I shall also call them),
though categorical in form, point beyond themselves in two ways. In the
first place they imply (in some sense of this protean term) a reason, a
because clause. The exploration of this theme would seem to take us
back to the excluded topic of hypothetical imperatives. In the second
place, though ought-to-be's are carefully to be distinguished from oughtto-do's they have an essential connection with them. The connection is,
roughly, that ought-to-be's imply ought-to-do's. Thus the ought-to-be
about clock chimes implies, roughly,
(Other things being equal and where possible) one ought to bring
it about that clock chimes strike on the quarter hour.
This rule belongs in our previous category, and is a rule of action.
As such it requires that the item to which it applies (persons rather than
chimes) have the appropriate concepts or recognitional capacities.
The distinction between ought-to-do's (rules of action) and ought-to- 
LANGUAGE AS THOUGHT AND AS COMMUNICATION 509
be's (rules of criticism) stands out clearly when the examples are suitably
chosen. A possibility of confusion arises, however, when the ought-to-be's
concern persons rather than inanimate objects. Consider, for example,
One ought to feel sympathy for bereaved people
This example is interesting for two reasons: (1) It is a rule conformity
to which requires that the subjects to which it applies have the concept
of what it is to be bereaved. In this respect it is like a rule of action.
(2) In the absence of a clear theory of action one might think of feeling
sympathy as an action. Thus a casual and uninformed look might lead
to the subsumption of the example under the form
One ought to do A, if C.
It is clear on reflection, however, that feeling sympathy is an action only
in that broad sense in which anything expressed by a verb in the active
voice is an action.
Nor should it be assumed that all ought-to-be's which apply to persons and concern their being in a certain state whenever a certain
circumstance obtains are such that the conformity to them of actual fact
requires that the persons in question have the concept of this circumstance. The point is of decisive importance for our problem. To set the
stage, consider ought-to-be's pertaining to the training of animals.
These rats ought-to-be in state cp, whenever C.
The conformity of the rats in question to this rule does not require that
they have a concept of C, though it does require that they be able to
respond differentially to cues emanating from C. Since the term 'recognitional capacity' is one of those accordion words which can be used
now in one sense now in another, it is a menace to sound philosophy.
On the other hand, the subjects of the ought-to-do's corresponding
to these ought-to-be's, i.e. the trainers, must have the concept both of
the desirable state p and of the circumstances in which the animals are
to be in it.
If we now return to the sympathy example, we notice another interesting feature. If we compare the ought-to-be with the corresponding
ought-to-do,
(Other things being equal and where possible) one ought to bring
it about that people feel sympathy for the bereaved,
we see that the 'subjects' of the ought-to-be (i.e., those who ought to
feel sympathy) coincide with the 'subjects' of the corresponding oughtto-do (i.e. those who ought to bring it about that people feel sympathy
for the bereaved). It is the same items (people) who are the agentsubjects of the ought-to-do and the subject-matter subjects of the oughtto-be. 
510 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH
III
It is obvious, from the above considerations, that if all rules of language, were ought-to-do's we would be precluded from explaining what
it is to have concepts in terms of rules of language. Now many rules
of language are ought-to-do's thus,
(Other things being equal) one ought to say such and such, if in C
and as such they can be efficacious in linguistic activity only to the
extent that people have the relevant concepts. It is therefore of the
utmost importance to note that many of the rules of language which are
of special interest to the epistemologist are ought-to-be's rather than
ought-to-do's. For only by taking this fact into account is it possible to
carry out a program according to which (a) linguistic activity is, in a
primary sense, conceptual activity; (b) linguistic activity is through and
through rule-governed.
Much attention has been devoted of late to linguistic actions 2 where
the term 'action' is taken in the strict sense of what an agent does, a
piece of conduct, a performance - the practical sense of action, as contrasted with the general metaphysical sense in which action is contrasted
with passion. The topic of linguistic actions, whether performatory,
locutionary, illocutionary, perlocutionary 3, or perhaps, elocutionary is
an important one. Indeed, it is important not only for a theory of
communication, but for epistemology, for there are, indeed, linguistic
actions which are of essential interest to the epistemologist: thus asking
questions and seeking to' answer them. On the other hand it can scarcely
be over-emphasized that to approach language in terms of the paradigm
of action is to make a commitment which, if the concept of action is
taken seriously, and the concept of rule is taken seriously, leads to (a)
the Cartesian idea of linguistic episodes as essentially the sort of thing
brought about by an agent whose conceptualizing is not linguistic; (b)
an inability to understand the rule-governed character of this conceptualizing itself, as contrasted' with its overt expression. For if thought is
analogous to linguistic activity to the extent implied by Plato's metaphor
'dialogue in the soul,' the idea that overt speech is action and its rules
rules of action will generate the idea that all inner speech is action and
its rules rules of action, which leads to paradox and absurdity without
end.
2 I have in mind particularly John Austin and his students. The best statement
of this approach is to be found in Austin's How to do Things with Words (London,
Oxford University Press, 1963.)
3 For an explanation and defense of these distinctions see Austin's How to do
Things with Words. 
LANGUAGE AS THOUGHT AND AS COMMUNICATION 511
I propose, instead that the epistemologist, while recognizing that language is an instrument of communication, should focus attention on
language as the bearer of conceptual activity. This is not to say that
the two aspects can be separated as with a knife. Indeed, by pointing
out that ought-to-be's imply ought-to-do's we have already recognized
that language users exist at the level of agents. Roughly, to be a being
capable of conceptual activity, is to be a being which acts, which recognizes norms and standards and engages in practical reasoning. It is, as
Kant pointed out, one and the same reason which is in some of its
activities 'theoretical,' and in some of its activities 'practical.' Of course,
if one gives to 'practical' the specific meaning ethical then a fairly sharp
separation of these activities can be maintained. But if one means by
'practical' pertaining to norms, then so-called theoretical reason is as
larded with the practical as is practical reasoning itself.
IV
Even if it be granted than many of the linguistic oughts which are
of special interest to an epistemologist are ought-to-be's, the fact that
ought-to-be's and ought-to-do's are conceptually inseparable might be
thought to preclude a linguistic approach to conceptual abilities. Clearly
primary epistemic ought-to-do's (and by calling them 'primary' I mean
simply that they are not the unfolding of ought-to-be's, whether as
primary they are categorical or hypothetical), pertaining to the systematic
use of linguistic abilities and propensities to arrive at correct linguistic
representations of the way things are, presuppose the possession of concepts by the agents to which they apply. And since all oughtto-be's
unfold into ought-to-do's which, in their turn, presuppose concepts, the
outlook for linguistic theory of concepts would seem to be dark indeed.
Yet the fundamental clues for a resolution of the problem have already
been given.
To fix our ideas, let us consider an example which, though simplified
to its bare bones contains the essence of the matter:
(Ceteris paribus) one ought to respond to red objects in sunlight by
uttering or being disposed to utter 'this is red.'
This ought-to-be rule must not be confused with (fictitious) ought-to-do
rule,
(Ceteris paribus) one ought to say 'this is red' in the presence of
red objects in sunlight
The latter presupposes that those to whom it applies have the concepts
of 'red' objects,' 'sunlight,' and, even more important, of what it is to 
512 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH
say 'this is red.' In other words, they must already have the conceptual
framework of what it is to do something in a circumstance.
The distinction between saying and uttering, or being disposed to utter,
is diagnostic of the difference between the 'ought-to-do' and the 'oughtto-be.' It might be objected that to use language meaningfully is to say
rather than merely utter. But to merely utter is to parrot, and we need
a concept which mediates between merely uttering and saying.
Notice that the ought-to-do which corresponds to the above oughtto-be, namely
One ought to bring it about (ceteris paribus) that people respond
to red objects in sunlight by uttering or being disposed to utter
'this is red.'
presupposes that its agent subjects have a conceptual framework which
includes the concepts of a red object, or sunlight, of uttering 'this is,
red,' of what it is to do or bring about something, and of what it is for
an action to be called for by a circumstance.
On the other hand, this ought-to-do does not presuppose that the
subjects in which the disposition to utter 'this is red' in the presence of
red objects in sunlight is to be brought about have any of these concepts.
But what of the objection that the subject-matter subjects of the oughtto-be coincide with the agent subjects of the ought-to-do and hence that
they too must have the concepts in question? The answer should be
obvious; the members of a linguistic community are first language
learners and only potentially 'people,' but subsequently language teachers,
possessed of the rich conceptual framework this implies. They start out
by being the subject-matter subjects of the ought-to-be's and graduate
to the status of agent subjects of the ought-to-do's. Linguistic ought-tobe's are translated into uniformities by training. As Wittgenstein has
stressed, it is the linguistic community as 'a self-perpetuating whole
which is the minimum unit in terms of which conceptual activity can
be understood.
Furthermore there are radically different kinds of linguistic ought-tobe's: not only word-object ought-to-be's (or, as I have called them elsewhere, language entry transitions) 4, but also the ought-to-be's formulated by formation and transformation rules.
4 "Some Reflections on Language Games," Philosophy of Science, Vol. 21, No. 3,
1954 (Reprinted as Chapter 11 in Science, Perception and Reality). It is important
to note that a full discussion would refer to may-be's (or permitteds) as well as
ought-to-be's - otherwise the concept of 'free' as opposed to 'tied' (stimulus bound)
linguistic activity, essential to any account of the functioning of a conceptual system, would be left out of the picture. 
LANGUAGE AS THOUGHT AND AS COMMUNICATION 513
The oughts governing utterances as perceptual responses to the environment are not ought-to-do's - though, as the pragmatists have
emphasized, perception as an element in enquiry occurs in a context of
actions, epistemic and otherwise. Similarly the oughts governing inference are not ought-to-do's. Inferring is not a doing in the conduct sense
- which, however, by no means implies that it is not a process. Again,
as the pragmatists have stressed, inference as an element in enquiry
occurs in the context of action, epistemic and otherwise.
A language is a many-leveled structure. There are not only the oughtto-be's which connect linguistic responses to extra-linguistic objects, but
also the equally essential ought-to-be's which connect linguistic responses
to linguistic objects. There could be no training of language users unless
this were the case. Finally, there would be no language training unless
there were the uniformities pertaining to the use of practical language,
the language of action, intention, of 'shall' and 'ought,' which, as
embodying epistemic norms and standards, is but one small (but essential) part of the conceptual structure of human agency.
One isn't a full-fledged member of the linguistic community until one
not only conforms to linguistic ought-to-be's (and may-be's) by exhibiting
the required uniformities, but grasps these ought-to-be's and may-be's
themselves (i.e., knows the rules of the language.) One must, therefore,
have the concept of oneself as an agent, as not only the subject-matter
subject of ought-to-be' but the agent-subject of ought-to-do's. Thus,
even though conceptual activity rests on a foundation of conforming to
ought-to-be's of uniformities in linguistic behavior, these uniformities
exists in an ambience of action, epistemic or otherwise. To be a language user is to conceive of oneself as an agent subject to rules. My
point has been that one can grant this without holding that all meaningful linguistic episodes are actions in the conduct sense, and all linguistic
rules, rules for doing.
A living language is a system of elements which play many different
types of roles, and no one of these types of role make sense apart from
the others. Thus, while the mere concept of a kind of vocalizing being
a response by a human organism in specified circumstances to a certain
kind of object does make sense in isolation, this concept is not as such
the concept of the vocalizing as a linguistic response. For to classify an
item as linguistic involves relating it to just such a system as I have
been sketching. 'Word' goes not only with 'object' but with 'person,'
'ought-to-be's,'ought-to-do's' and much, much more. 
514 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH
V
Within the framework sketched above, I propose to explore the idea
that insofar as it has conceptual meaning, language is essentially a means
whereby one thinker can express his thoughts to others. Now the term
'thought' has a wide range of application, including such items as assumptions, the solving of problems, wishes, intentions, and perceptions. It is
also ambiguous, sometimes referring to what is thought, sometimes to
the thinking of it. To limit the range of my paper, I shall concentrate
on thought as belief, and since the latter term shares the ambiguity
indicated above, I note that for the time being at least, I shall be concerned with believings rather than things believed.
The following characterization of the state of believing something will
serve to get the discussion under way
Jones believes that-p = Jones has a settled disposition to think
that-p.
It would be foolhardy - indeed downright mistaken - to claim that this
formula captures 'the' meaning of believes, and even more so to put it
by saying that 'a belief is a settled disposition to think that something
is the case.' For, as with most, if not all, of the words in which philosophers are interested, we are confronted with a cluster of senses which
resemble each other in the family way.
To say that the senses of cognate expressions bear a family resemblance to one another must not be taken to imply that they present
themselves as a family, nor even that they constitute a family. Aristotle
seems to have thought that philosophically interesting concepts present
themselves to us as families in which, with a little effort, we can discern
the fathers, mothers, aunts, uncles, and cousins of various degrees. In
some cases something like this may be true. But the matter is rarely so
simple, and there is more than a little truth to the idea that the families
are 'created' by reconstruction (hopefully rational) or regimentation rather
than found.5
If the above account of belief gets us started, it does so by confronting
us with the equally problematic concepts of disposition and thinking
that-p. Before stepping into these quicksands, let us ostensibly make
matters worse by turning our attention from believing itself to the more
complicated concept of the expression of belief. For sound philosophical
5 Equally dangerous are such mephorical contrasts as those between 'paradigm'
and 'borderline,' 'shadow' and 'penumbra.' All suggest a sequential strategy according to which, once we find the thread, we know how to begin and what kinds of
difficulty to expect. 
LANGUAGE AS THOUGHT AND AS COMMUNICATION 515
strategy calls for the examination of concepts as they function in larger
contexts, rather than subjecting them to scrutiny in splendid isolation.
By taking elusive concepts together, one may limit the degrees of freedom which enable them separately to elude our grasp. If beliefs are to
be construed as dispositions, this strategy would have us seek to relate
the sense in which beliefs are 'expressed' to the sense in which the dispositions of things and persons are manifested by what they do. This
suggests the schema
x expresses Jones' belief that-p x is a manifestation of Jones settled disposition to think that-p.
If the right hand side of this attempted explication were clearcut and
unambiguous, substantial progress would have been made. But it isn't;
and our only hope is that a spark of clarity may result from rubbing
unclarities together.
A first unclarity concerns what it is for a disposition to be 'manifested'
by a doing, and how the class of doings by which a given disposition is
manifested is to be delimited. If the 'disposition' is of the familiar kind
to which we refer by such expressions as 'an angry disposition' or, perhaps, by such a term as 'humility,' then it would seem that, depending
on circumstances, any of a wide range of episodes could be its manifestation. Indeed, there is a sense in which, depending on circumstances,
any of a wide range of episodes could count as a 'manifestation' of
Jones' belief that-p. But, to characterize belief that-p as a settled disposition to think that-p, is, if sound, to narrow things down in an interesting way. For to do so, is to introduce a conceptual tie between the
designation of the disposition and the kind of episodes which can be
said, at least in a primary sense, to 'manifest' it.
For if we ask what episodes manifest a disposition to V, when 'V'
represents a verb which stands for a doing (e.g. 'laugh') the answer must
be, in the first instance, episodes of V-ing (e.g. laughing). We have consequently committed ourselves to the idea that it is episodes of thinking
that-p which are, in a primary sense at least, manifestations of Jones'
disposition to think that-p; and consequently that it is episodes of thinking
that-p which are, in a primary sense, manifestations of Jones' belief
that-p. This gives us the schema
x is a primary manifestation of Jones' belief that-p -e x is a thinking
that-p.
But now our troubles really begin. For there is a prima fadie tension
between 'being a thinking that-p' and being a 'manifestation' of anything.
The latter term carries with it the implication of 'making something
manifest,' i.e., apparent, (roughly) perceptible, observable. But, we are 
516 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH
tempted to expostulate, what need be less 'manifest' than an episode of
thinking that-p.
It might be thought that all we need do is replace 'manifestation' by
a term which lacks this implication. And there are, indeed, such terms
at hand - thus 'realization,'actualization.' The statements
episodes of thinking that-p are realizations of the settled disposition
to think that-p
episodes of thinking that-p are actualizations of the settled disposition to think that-p
trip easily off the metaphysically trained tongue. But they are ruled out
by our strategy. For the concept with which we are concerned is that
of the expression of a belief, and 'expression' clearly has the same
implication of 'overtness' or 'perceptibility' as does the 'manifestation' to
which our initial intuitions have led us.
The boulder may have slipped, but perhaps it has not rolled to the
bottom. Our task may ultimately prove to be like that of Sisyphus, but
perhaps we are not yet forced to make a new beginning. To continue is
to look for a way of making coherent the idea that episodes of thinking
that-p are the primary expressions (with all that this implies) of the belief that-p.
To do so within the allotted space however, I must abandon the
leisurely dialectic which consults intuition at each stage of the argument,
and instead must draw upon the familiarity of standard philosophical
moves. In terms of this new strategy, the obvious move is to espouse a
form of logical behaviorism according to which, in first approximation,
'thinking that-p' is, in its most episodic sense, to be equated with 'candidly and spontaneously uttering "p"' 6 where the person, call him
Jones, who utters 'p' is doing so as one who knows the language to which
'p' belongs. I need not remind you of all the troubles which beset this
move. Some of them will be taken into account as the argument moves
along. But since, in any case, my strategy remains in a broad sense
dialectical, the fact that the above equation suffers from serious inadequacies need not prevent it from playing an essential role in the argument
The phrase 'candidly and spontaneously' is intended to sum up an
open-ended set of conditions without which the suggestion can't get off
the ground. Jones' thinking that-p obviously cannot be a quoting of 'p'
or uttering it on the stage in the course of acting. The qualifying phrase
also clearly rules out the case where Jones is lying, i.e. using words to
6 Similarly, 'wondering whether-p' would be equated with 'uttering "p?"', 'wishing that-p' with 'uttering "would (that) p"' and 'deciding to do A' with uttering
'I shall do A.' 
LANGUAGE AS THOUGHT AND AS COMMUNICATION 517
deceive. Somewhat less obviously it is intended to imply that Jones is
not choosing his words to express his convictions. He is neither lying
nor speaking truthfully. In a sense, as we shall see, he is not using the
words at all.
According to the behavioristic position we are now considering,
thinking that-p is, in its primary episodic sense, thinking-out-loud that-p.
As thinking-out-loud, an utterance of 'p' is not directed to an audience.
It is not, as such, a social act. Explicit performatives (e.g. 'I promise')
are clearly out of place in utterances which are, in the desired sense,
to be thinkings-out-loud. Nor is it appropriate to characterize thinkingsout-loud in terms of the categories of illocutionary performance - at
least those which require an audience (e.g. 'statement,' 'avowal,' 'argument') 7 - even though exactly similar utterances would, in a context of
'communication,' be appropriately so characterized.
VI
It is important to realize that the ways in which we classify linguistic
expressions are not only bound up with the jobs they do, but with the
purposes for which the classification is made. Since these purposes tend,
for obvious reasons, to concern the role of language as a means of communication, i.e., as that by which we give information, warn, make
statements, predict, describe, etc., we should not be surprised, our behaviorist will tell us, if expressions which, as candidly uttered in noncommunicative contexts, are thinging-out-loud, are classified in a way
which is conceptually tied to communication, and, hence, to functions of
quite a different order of complexity. One needs only think of the difference between the purely logical characterization of 'it is not raining'
as the 'negation' of 'it is raining,' and characterizing it as the 'denial'
of the latter, or note the social implications of classifying a word as a
referring expression.
Thus the ways in which common sense, and not only common sense,
classifies linguistic expressions, and the verbs which it uses to describe
what people do with them, are heavily weighted in the direction of linguistic performances in a context of communication. That it is legitimate
to view language in this way is not to be doubted. Indeed, it is philosophically important to be clear about the categories in terms of which
the variety of ways in which language functions in inter-personal exchange
7 We can grant that a thinking-out-loud that-p might be a constituent of a
reasoning-out-loud or a deliberating-out-loud on a certain topic. 
518 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH
are to be understood. But there is a danger that exclusive concern with
this perspective will obscure those connections between thought and language where the latter is not functioning as a means of communication.
The point is not that there are failures of communication, e.g. the
supposed hearer may be an inanate object mistaken for a man or a
foreigner. It is not even that there are soliloquies, if by this is meant
cases of 'talking to oneself.' It is the more radical point that thinkingout-loud is a form of meaningful speech which doesn't consist in talking
to anyone at all, even oneself, and hence is not, in any ordinary sense,
talking.
VII
But before I develop this point let me return to the formula we were
considering before this digression on the orientation toward contexts of
communication of the categories in terms of which common sense, linguistics, and many philosophies of language approach linguistic behavior.
The formula was
x is a primary expression of Jones' belief that-p
- x is a primary manifestation of his settled disposition to think
that-p (i.e. is a thinking that-p).
The implications of the term 'manifestation' (and, for that matter, of
'expression') led us in the direction of a logical behaviorism according
to which the relevant sense of 'thinking that-p' is 'thinking-out-loud
that-p.' Thus reinterpreted, the formula becomes
x is a primary expression of Jones' belief that-p
x is a primary manifestation of Jones' settled disposition to
think-out-loud that-p (i.e., is a thinking out-loud that-p).
It will be remembered that the point of this behavioristic move was
to assimilate the sense in which an episode is a primary expression
(implying overtness) of a belief to the sense in which an episode of, for
example, a piece of litmus paper turning red is a manifestation (implying
overtness) of its disposition to turn red.
It should be noted in passing that in the case of the litmus paper we
seem required to expand the characterization of the disposition into
disposition to turn red, if put in acid.
This generates the suspicion that if we are to continue with our strategy,
we must similarly expand our analysis of 'Jones believes that-p' into
Jones has a settled disposition to think-out-loud that-p, if.
If what? There many pitfalls here, though we can, perhaps, cover them
up temporarily with something like 'if the question whether-p arises.' To
do so, however, would immediately confront us with a more serious 
LANGUAGE AS THOUGHT AND AS COMMUNICATION 519
difficulty. For it simply isn't the case that if a person believes that-p.
he utters 'p' let alone thinks-out-loud that-p, whenever the question
whether-p arises.
Confronted by this fact, we are strongly tempted to abandon our
strategy and say that if a person believes that-p, then (other things being
equal) whenever the question whether-p arises, he tends to think (not
think-out-loud) that-p; to which we might add that if the circumstances
are appropriate he may express his thought by uttering (saying?) 'p.'
VIII
On the other hand, if, however? we are to continue with our original
strategy, we must resolutely put aside the temptation to draw the kind
of distinction between thought and its expression which this formulation
implies, and continue with the intriguing idea that an uttering of 'p'
which is a primary expression of a belief that-p is not merely an expression of a thinking that-p, but is itself a thinking, i.e., a thinking-out-loud
that-p.
Yet the preceding remarks do remind us that we must take into
account the fact that there is a sense of 'express' in which we can be
said to express our thoughts by using language for this purpose. Thus,
we express our thought that-p by saying 'p.' Can we sophisticate our
logical behaviorism to do justice to this fact?
Let us take a closer look at the words 'thought' and 'express.' First
the latter: it will be noticed that the reference to observability implied
by the term 'manifestation' in the context 'manifestation of the disposition to think that-p' was absorbed by the behaviorist into the phrase
which describes the disposition. Thus, 'manifestation of the disposition
to think that-p,' became, in effect 'actualization of the disposition to
think-out-loud that-p.'
Thus the behaviorist's formula becomes, in effect,
x is a primary expression of Jones' belief that-p
x is a manifestation of Jones' settled disposition to think that-p
- x is an actualization of Jones' settled disposition to think-outloud that-p (i.e., x is a thinking-out-loud that-p).
It is only too clear that by pushing this analysis of the context 'expression of belief' in this direction the behaviorist has lost contact with the
idea that people express their beliefs by using language. The point can
be put simply - indeed bluntly - by saying that the concept of the
actualization of a disposition is not, as such, the concept of an action,
whereas expressing their beliefs is something people do. 
520 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH
The statement
Jones, by saying 'p', expressed his belief that-p
requires an interpretation of saying p as an action which is undertaken
by Jones in order to express (to someone) his belief that-p. If we suspect
that Jones is lying, we could equally describe him as saying "p", but
we would then go on to say something like
Jones, by saying 'p', pretended to believe that-p.
In neither case could Jones' saying 'p' be construed as a case of
thinking (even 'out loud') that-p. Thus were Jones speaking truthfully,
the thinking immediately involved, if any, would be of the sort described
by such formulas as
Jones thought that saying '...' would express his belief that-p
Jones intended to express his belief that-p by saying ...
or, in the case of lying
Jones intended to pretend to believe that-p by saying ....
Thus, granted the validity of the concept of thinking-out-loud, the
thinking-out-loud which, were it to occur, would be immediately involved in the situation formulated by
Jones, by uttering '...,' expressed his belief that-p
would be not
Jones thought-out-loud that-p
but rather
Jones thought-out-loud that saying '...' would express his belief
that-p
or, where Jones is lying,
Jones thought-out-loud that he would pretend to believe that-p by
saying ....
Needless to say, the latter thinking-out-loud would be self-frustrating in
the presence of the audience he intends to deceive.
Ix
If we leave behaviorism aside for a moment, we can add a new
dimension to the discussion by noting that the term 'express' in contexts
pertaining to thought has two radically different senses. The difference
can be brought out by relating these senses to two different contexts,
namely,
(1) Jones expressed his thought (belief) that-p by saying ...
(2) Jones' utterance of 'p' expressed his thought that-p
I shall call the former the 'action' sense of express, and the latter, 
LANGUAGE AS THOUGHT AND AS COMMUNICATION 521
for want of a better term, the 'causal' sense. Both, as we shall see, are
to be distinguished from a third sense illustrated by the context
Jones' utterance of 'p' expressed the thought that-p
where the phrase 'the thought that-p' stands for an abstract entity, a
thought in Frege's sense (i.e., in one sense of this term, a 'proposition').
I shall call this the logical (or semantical) sense of 'express.'
Although my ultimate aim is to show how a logical behaviorist might
draw these distinctions, my initial move will be to discuss them in more
traditional terms. I shall, therefore, construct a regimented (I dare not
say idealized) model according to which, in the course of learning to
speak a language, a child acquires the capacity to be in mental states
which are counterparts, in a sense to be analyzed, of the utterances
which come to belong to his repertory of linguistic behavior. The idea
can be blocked out in two steps:
(a) A mental episode which is a thinking that-p is correlated, in
a certain linguistic community, with a piece of linguistic behavior which stands for (expresses in the logical or semantical
sense) the thought (proposition) that-p
(b) In the initial stages of the child's mastery of the language,
whenever it has a thought that-p, this thought is manifested in
a purely involuntary way by the corresponding verbal behavior.
As our model for understanding the sense in which the uttering of
'p' is the involuntary manifestation of a thinking that-p, let us take the
instinctive connection between a pain and a piece of unlearned pain
behavior. The fact that a connection between states A and B of a child
is, in some sense, learned rather than instinctive, acquired rather than
part of its initial equipment, by no means entails that either A or B is
under the child's voluntary control. Not all learning to, do something in
a broad sense of 'do' consists in the addition of new behaviors to the
stock of things that are under one's voluntary control.
The key feature of our model is that the acquired connection between
the mental act and the verbal behavior is not to be construed on the
action model of 'using the behavior to express one's thought.' Thus,
verbal behavior is not in our child's voluntary control in that, although,
once the language is learned, a necessary and sufficient condition of the
child saying 'p' is that it thinks that-p, the saying is the involuntary
manifestation of the thinking.
Notice that the model allows the child a rich vocabulary, including
the language of intention and resolve as well as the language in which
matters-of-fact are stated. It also allows that the child learns to verbalize 
522 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH
about verbal behavior and even about the mental acts of which its verbal
behavior is the involuntary manifestation.
X
We are now in a position to weaken our model and still make our
point. We need not suppose that the child remains a chatterbox. We
can suppose it to acquire the ability to keep its thoughts to itself in
the sense that it can effectively tell itself to keep quiet, without ceasing
to think. We can grant that to this limited extent its verbal behavior
becomes under its voluntary control. When it is thinking without
speaking, we shall say that it is in a keeping-its-thoughts-to-itself frame
of mind. When not in this frame of mind, it thinks out loud. 8 Thus,
'Thinking out loud' remains the primary form in which thinking occurs.
The child's keeping its thoughts to itself can be compared to the opening
of a general switch which breaks (or, to mix metaphors) short circuits
the initial acquired connection between thoughts and verbal behavior.
At this stage, the child has no conception of locutionary acts (e.g.
predicting, telling) as verbal behavior which can be engaged in whether
or not one is thinking the corresponding thoughts. It has no concept of
saying "p" without thinking that-p.
On the other hand, it is perfectly capable of having concepts of
actions involving thinking out loud. Thus, wondering out loud about the
weather; "I shall wonder out loud about the likelihood of rain." It is
important to see that this by no means entails that there is such a thing
as an action of thinking out loud that-p. Even in our more sophisticated
framework there is no such thing as an action of thinking that-p, though
there is the action of deliberating (i.e., deliberating out loud) what to
do. By granting, as we must, that it can conceive of actions consisting
of thinkings out loud, we admit a further sense in which its verbal
behavior (as thinkings out loud) would be under its voluntary control.
The child's verbal behavior would express its thoughts, but, to put it
paradoxically, the child could not express them.
Notice, also, that although its linguistic behavior would be meaningful,
and we could say of each of its utterances what, specifically it meant, e.g.
Jones' utterance meant 'it is raining,'
It would, on our assumptions, be incorrect to say, for example
Jones, by uttering '...' meant (to convey) ..
8 The concept of 'thinking out loud' appropriate to this model should not be
equated with thinking-out-loud as construed by the behavioristic position we have
been considering. The latter does not recognize 'mental episodes' in the sense
required by the present model. 
LANGUAGE AS THOUGHT AND AS COMMUNICATION 523
For the latter supposes that Jones has the concept of an action of
uttering '....' as a piece of linguistic behavior which could exist independently of its being the "spontaneous verbal expression" of the
corresponding mental act. There being no such action as bringing about
a specific mental act, there could be no such thing as bringing about a
thinking out loud for the purpose of conveying a thought.
In other words, just as our regimenting fiction enables us to draw a
distinction between a sense in which a mode of verbal behavior can
express thoughts without being used to express them, so it enables us
to distinguish between the context
utterance of E (in L) means ---
and the sense of 'means,' closely related to 'intends,' which involves the
context
Jones, by uttering E, means (to convey) ...
The familiar saw that words have meaning only because people mean
things by them is harmless if it tells us that words have no meaning in
abstraction from their involvement in the verbal behavior of language
users. It is downright mistaken if it tells us that for an expression to
have a certain sense or reference is for it to be used by people to convey
the corresponding thought. Rather, we should say, it is because the
expression has a certain meaning that it can be effectively used to convey
the corresponding thought.
XI
Let us now return to the initial accounts we gave of belief and its
expression. The first thing to note is that if we were to reformulate them
in terms of our model we would get something like the following schema
Jones believes that-p - Jones has a settled disposition to think
that-p, if the question occurs to him
whether-p, and, indeed, to think out loud
that-p, unless he is in a keeping-histhoughts-to-himself frame of mind.9
We also get the following formulae with respect to 'expression of belief':
x is a primary actualization of Jones' belief that-p -- x is a thinking
that-p (and, indeed, a thinking out loud
that-p unless he is in a keeping-histhoughts-to himself frame of mind.)
' The 'if the question occurs to him whether-p' condition can be taken to cover
all cases in which, where the alternatives 'p' and 'not p' are relevant to his course
of thought, he thinks that-p, even if the question whether-p is not actually raised. 
524 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH
x is a primary expression of Jones' belief that-p -e x is a thinking
out loud that-p.
Thus, where Jones is in a thinking out loud frame of mind, the verbal
behavior is both an actualization of and, in the 'causal' sense, an expression of his belief, both a thinking and an expression of thought.
XII
But what will our logical behaviorist say to all this? Clearly he will be
unhappy about our uncritical acceptance of mental acts as covert inner
episodes. What moves might he make? He may well accept our initial
formula
Jones believes that-p Jones has a settled disposition to think
that-p.
But he will emphasize the 'settled,' which we have not yet done, and will
call attention to the fact that it presumably contrasts with something. It
is not obvious what the contrasting adjective should be, but it, too, should
apply to dispositions. Let us, he suggests, try 'proximate,' drawing on
the contrast between 'settled' and 'near the surface.' Another appropriate
contrast would be provided by 'short term.'
Objects, as is well known, can have causal properties which are not
so to speak, immediately available. Thus iron attracts filings, if it has
been treated in a certain way. A proximate disposition can roughly be
characterized as one which is immediately available.
Our logical behaviorist, consequently, suggests that
Jones believes that-p = Jones has the settled disposition to have
short term, proximate dispositions to
think-out-loud that-p, if the question
whether-p arises, and he is in a thinkingout-loud frame of mind.
In other words, our logical behaviorist construes the contrast between
fleeting thought episodes and settled beliefs as falling within the broad
category of dispositions, and hence construes the 'covertness' of thoughts
as simply a special case of the covertness of dispositions. Flammability,
he reminds us, is not a covert flame.
Many features of our previous discussion can be fitted into this framework, once its distinctive character is understood. Thus, the behaviorist
substitutes for the previous account of the child's candid and spontaneous verbal behavior as the expression (in the 'causal' sense) of classically
conceived episodes of thought, an account according to which a
thinking-out-loud that-p
is simply an 'actualization' of a 
LANGUAGE AS THOUGHT AND AS COMMUNICATION 525
short term proximate, disposition to think-out-loud that-P.
In the non-behavioristic model we stipulated that the child be unable
to verbalize without thinking the appropriate thought, in other words,
that only if it has the mental act of thinking that-p does it utter 'p.' In
the behavioristic reconstruction framework, the corresponding stipulation
would be that all utterances of 'p' be thinking-out-loud that-p.
Both stipulations could be formulated in the same words, thus 'the
child utters "p" only in the course of thinking out loud that-p.' But the
two concepts of thinking out loud are radically different. In the nonbehavioristic model, the phrase 'thinking-out-loud' referred to thoughts
together with their verbal expression. In the behavioristic reconstruction
it is to be taken as an unanalyzed expression which means roughly the
same as 'candid' spontaneous verbal behavior,' but serves, by its hyphenated mode of composition, to emphasize that the basic meaningfulness
of candid, spontaneous verbal behavior is not to be construed in terms
of its being the reverberation at the tip of the tongue of covert episodes
which are thoughts properly speaking, in accordance with the schema
x is candid, spontaneous verbal behavior = is an expression 10 of
thought
XIII
It is important not to confuse logical behaviorism with what might be
called logical physicalism. I mean by the latter the view which denies
that, to quote Chisholm, "when we analyze the kind of meaning that is
involved in natural language we need some concepts we do not need in
physics or behavioristics." 'I Chisholm thinks that to deny the need for
such an irreducible concept is tantamount to trying to "analyze the
semantics ... of natural language in a physicalistic vocabulary of a
behavioristic psychology with no undefined semantical term and no
reference to thoughts." 12
In the essay which led to the correspondence from which I am quoting,
I had argued that the concept of meaning which belongs in the context
E(in L) means ---
is not to be analyzed in terms of a reference to 'thoughts.' Thus I
rejected any analysis along either of the following lines
E(in L) means --- = candid and spontaneous utterances of F
causally express thoughts pertaining to ---
10 'Expression' in the causal sense, i.e., a manifestation at the 'surface' of a covert
process which is its cause.
11 Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science, Vol. II, p. 523.
12 Ibid. 
526 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH
E(in L) means - - = speakers of L use E to express their
thoughts pertaining to ---
where 'thought' is to be taken as referring to classically conceived inner
episodes or mental acts.
On the other hand, though I denied that 'means' in the sense appropriate to the context 'E(in L) means - - -' is to be analyzed (defined) in
terms of a reference to thoughts, I also argued that it cannot be analyzed
in physicalistic terms. From Chisholm's point of view this was a blatant
attempt to have my cake and eat it. As he saw it, to admit that "to
analyze the kind of meaning that is involved, in natural language" we
need a distinctively semantical term ('means') which cannot be analyzed
in physicalistic terms, but deny that the explication of this distinctively
semantical term requires a reference to thoughts has all the appearance
of paradox.
The correspondence went on at some length, and although some
progress was made, the issue was never really joined. As I now diagnose
the situation some ten years later, the cause of this failure was my inability to clarify adequately two, points:
(a) The exact nature of statements of the form 'E(in L) means -- -'
(b) The exact relation of the concept of meaning to that of thought.
The space which remains is too short to do anything more than indicate
the moves I should have made.
My basic move should have been to clarify along the lines of the
present paper the distinction between the contexts
person expresses
and
utterance expresses.
My second move should have been to give a more adequate clarification of the concept of meaning as it occurs in the context 'expression
(in L) means -- -' (as contrasted with the context 'person, by uttering E,
means - - -.') At the time of the correspondence I was unable to do
much more than offer the rather cryptic suggestion that statements of
this form are (a) sui generis, (b) convey (rather than describe) how the
subject expression is used, by exhibiting an expression in the hearer's
active vocabulary which has the same job - the idea being that by
rehearsing his use of the latter, he will be able to grasp the use of the
former. As I have since argued,'3 to say what an expression means is
to classify it by the use of a sortal predicate the application of which
implies that the expression in question does the job in its language which
13 Most recently in Science and Metaphysics, Chapter m. 
LANGUAGE AS THOUGHT AND AS COMMUNICATION 527
is done in the speaker's language by an expression from which the
predicate is formed. Thus, roughly
'und' (in German) means and
has the form
'und's (in German) are 'and's
where 'and"' is a sortal predicate of the kind in question.
But above all I should have made it clear that in my view the fundamental concept pertaining to thinking is thinking-out-loud as conceived
by our logical behaviorists.'4 This is not to say that I agree with him
in rejecting the classical conception of thoughts as inner episodes in a
non-dispositional sense. Rather I accept mental acts in something like
the classical sense, but argue that the concept of such acts is, in a sense
I have attempted to clarify, a derivative concept.
Finally, I should have emphasized my total commitment to the thesis
that the concept of thought essentially involves that of intentionality in
the following sense. To say of a piece of verbal behavior that it is a
thinking-out-loud, is to commit oneself to say of it that it means something, while to say of it specifically that it is a thinking-out-loud that-p,
is to commit oneself to say of it that it is a piece of verbal behavior
which means p.
Thus, at the primary level, instead of analyzing the intentionality or
aboutness of verbal behavior in terms of its expressing or being used to
express classically conceived thoughts or beliefs, we should recognize that
this verbal behavior is already thinking in its own right, and its intentionality or aboutness is simply the appropriateness of classifying it in
terms which relate to the linguistic behavior of the group to which one
belongs.

14 The priority in question, to use Aristotle's distinction, is in the order of
knowing as contrasted with the order of being. As an analogy, notice that concepts pertaining to things as perceived by the senses are prior in the order of
knowing to concepts of micro-physical particles, whereas, (for the Scientific Realist)
micro-physical particles are prior in the order of being to objects as perceived by
the senses.
