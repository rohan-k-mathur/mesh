There is a quite outstanding and surprising fact about today’s philosophical
life in America, namely, the return of Hegelian philosophy to the debates
among American philosophers, and even analytic philosophers are taking
an active part in that process. Nothing of the kind could be observed at
least since the time of the St. Louis and Ohio Hegelians of the nineteenth
century. From the beginning of the triumphal march of analytic philosophy
through the Anglo-American philosophical world, the philosophy of Hegel
seemed to appear to any impartial observer obsolete and abandoned for
good.
However, at the dawn of the twenty-first century, American authors proclaimed in concert “the revival of Hegelian philosophy” and even “Hegel’s
Renaissance.”1
 The editor of a collection of essays dedicated to the legacy of
German idealism, E. Hammer, writes in the preface:
Few trends in contemporary philosophy seem stronger and more
influential than the resurgence and revival of themes and arguments
that owe their origin to thinkers associated with German idealism.
Not only has scholarship (particularly in the Anglo-American context)
on figures such as Kant, Fichte, Schelling and Hegel become more

sophisticated, prestigious and creative than it has been for a long
time, but the innovative uses to which idealist motifs have recently
been put have changed the nature of many philosophical debates.
Drawing on strong readings and reconceptualizing traditional arguments, philosophers working in fields as different as epistemology,
philosophy of language, political theory, ethics and aesthetics have
opened new intellectual vistas while reinvigorating others. For central thinkers of our time such as Robert Brandom, Stanley Cavell,
Jürgen Habermas, John McDowell, Hilary Putnam, and many others,
Kant and Hegel are household names whose writings have served as
a basis for the development of their own work.2
Such remarks, although they might look somewhat exaggerated, nevertheless reflect the real process occurring in contemporary philosophical
thought, which requires consideration.
Richard Bernstein, one of the most significant representatives of contemporary American pragmatism, outlines three main factors that, according to him, led gradually to the change in the attitude of American thinkers
toward Hegelian philosophy.3
 First is a political one—philosophers who
were politically active and interested in a “humanistic” Marx in the 1950s
and 1960s turned to Hegel as the primary source of Marxist social philosophy. Frederick Beiser also draws our attention to this political factor in his
analysis of Hegel scholarship in the United States.4
The second circumstance favorable to a Hegel revival is that there was
a group of American philosophers who were not satisfied with the limits of
analytic philosophy and, while in search of wider horizons, discovered Hegel
as a rich source of philosophical material. This group, according to Bernstein,
included Charles Taylor, Alisdair MacIntyre, Richard Rorty, and himself.
Alongside Bernstein’s analysis we can put the considerations of Richard
Rorty, who describes in his writings the “pragmatization” of contemporary
analytic philosophy in America, which, among other things, has broadened
the cultural and historical horizons of analytic philosophy and involves the
Continental tradition, a process hailed and propelled by Rorty himself. The
pragmatization of analytic philosophy as represented by Rorty has strongly
influenced the rehabilitation of Hegelian thought in America. In Rorty’s
words, the results of this antireductionist and anti-empiricist polemic
“were such that something which seemed much like idealism began to
become intellectually respectable.”5

accentuated remark and explains the revival in such a way that the ties
between Hegel and contemporary American thought begin to look quite
solid and historically justified: “Various representatives of neopragmatism
refer to Hegel because in Hegel’s idealism the central themes of neopragmatism can already be identified as preconfigured, or at least can be traced
to their origins.”6
 These preliminary remarks make us consider with seriousness the third factor according to Bernstein.
The third factor Bernstein mentions is the work of Wilfrid Sellars.
Wilfrid Sellars is really the right figure to start the talk about contemporary
American Hegelianism. Sellars belongs to that group of thinkers, alongside Quine, Davidson, Rorty, Kuhn, and Feyerabend, that played the crucial
role in the “pragmatization of analytic philosophy,” accompanied by the
severe critique of its basic principles in the form of a critique of its “dogmas.” More than that, if we take the contemporary “Pittsburgh School of
Philosophy” (Sellars, Brandom, McDowell)—another name for this group
of thinkers is the “Pittsburgh Hegelians”—then we can clearly see that at the
root of its origin stands the figure of a professor at Pittsburgh University—
Wilfrid Sellars. John McDowell, one of the leading representatives of the
Pittsburgh school, is a follower of Sellars. Moreover, Sellars’s work obviously influenced Rorty himself and, via Rorty and even directly, the work
of another leading thinker of the Pittsburgh school—Robert Brandom. At
least these two circumstances lead us to a consideration of Sellars as a key
figure in the process of Hegel’s revival.
Another aspect of Sellars’s work should also be mentioned. As many
researchers point out, Sellars is renowned for his strong knowledge of the
history of philosophy and permanent inclination to use it as a means of
handling contemporary issues of philosophy; that side of him distinguishes
Sellars among other analytic philosophers who usually pay little attention if
at all to past philosophical thought. Also Sellars, unlike many other philosophers from the analytic camp, with all respect to modern science and its
authority (“science is the measure of all things”), tries not to isolate science
from the rest of human culture. He not only opposes science and other
fields of culture, which is a distinguishing feature of analytic philosophy
since its birth, but also makes attempts to reconcile the outlooks of both,
as can be seen in his article “Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man,”
where Sellars not only draws a line between the manifest and the scientific
images of humans but expresses the desire to achieve a combined position,
synthesizing both images.7
JSP 26.4_05_Selivanov.indd 679 26/10/12 5:26 PM

And last but not least, it was Sellars who restored the philosophical
use of Hegel in the middle of the 1950s and brought his name back to the
pages of serious philosophical discussions. As Rorty notes, Sellars was the
first leading figure in analytic thought who openly referenced Hegel in his
works.8
In this respect, Sellars was a salient exception, adds one of his followers
today, John McDowell.9
 And he was indeed. But because of this we can now
firmly put him at the very beginning of the rehabilitation of Hegel (gradual
and reserved in many aspects), which has resulted nowadays in that Hegel
Renaissance, something a considerable number of commentators proclaim
to be the most striking feature of contemporary American thought.
In this essay I am going to analyze that part of Sellars’s work that contains or, rather, implies the specifically Hegelian material. The analysis will
be focused on the most famous of his works—Empiricism and the Philosophy
of Mind (1956; originally Sellars’s lectures delivered at the University of
London and published later under the title “The Myth of the Given. Three
Lectures on Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind”). Sellars himself
characterized his work as “incipient Meditations Hegeliènnes.”10
It is widely recognized that the most influential part of Sellars’s legacy
is related to his critique of the “Myth of the Given.” As Sellars points out at
the very beginning of his work, the subject matter of the monograph is not
just the notion of the given and its critique but, rather, an analysis of the
framework rooted in the very body of the Western philosophical tradition
from its beginning in antiquity to the present.
The notion of the given is closely related to the notion of immediacy.
Assuming this, Sellars in his considerations almost equates these terms.
Significantly enough, on the very same page where Sellars introduces
the notion of immediacy he refers directly to Hegel. It is Hegel’s meaning of
immediacy that is discussed here, points out Sellars. And we can conclude
that in his own approach Sellars leans upon or at least takes into account
Hegel’s critique of immediacy. Hegel is the “great foe of ‘immediacy’”—that
is the way Sellars introduces the German philosopher to the reader.11
Even more intriguing and promising appears the author’s remark that
his work can be viewed as Hegelian meditations.12 However, these are actually the only references to Hegel that we find in Sellars’s text. Nowhere
else in the book does Sellars give any detailed analysis of Hegel’s work or
discuss any of Hegel’s texts in particular.
JSP 26.4_05_Selivanov.indd 680 26/10/12 5:26 PM
the “myth of the given” 681
This obvious fact, however, has not confused or disoriented Sellars
scholars, who are unanimous in asserting that the comparison between
Hegel and Sellars at this point is more than justified. And even more than
that, these researchers point out more precisely that Sellars’s critique of
the given is developed in parallel with Hegel’s critique of consciousness in
the first three chapters of The Phenomenology of Spirit. Most probably the
first author who drew attention to this aspect of Sellars’s work was Richard
Bernstein, who in 1971, in his book Praxis and Action, wrote about the three
chapters of Hegel’s Phenomenology as “perceptive and incisive commentary
and critique of a dialectical development in epistemology which has been
repeated in contemporary analytic philosophy.”13
Bernstein’s idea was adopted by Richard Rorty, who makes the direct
comparison between the Sellars work and the first chapter of Phenomenology,
dedicated to the critique of sinnliche Gewissheit, sense certainty.14 In the contemporary literature on Sellars this proposition can be considered as firmly
established. The followers of Sellars and prominent Hegel scholars, such
as John McDowell, Robert Brandom, Terry Pinkard, Robert Pippin, Tom
Rockmore, and Paul Redding, are all in concord about the fact.15
Despite this definite indication I have failed to find in the philosophical literature the attempts to compare directly the considerations of Sellars
with Hegel’s passages in The Phenomenology of Spirit. This will be the task
in the present essay.
First of all I will try to give an analysis and description of the so-called
Myth of the Given or the framework of givenness in Sellars’s work. There
is no single and embracing account of the Myth of the Given in Sellars’s
work. The discussions and commentaries are scattered throughout the
monograph and give no single clue to its exposition. That is why we have
to design our own thread of considerations, which will provide us with
the main features of the Myth of the Given, keeping in mind the parallels
between Sellars and Hegel.
The key notion for Sellars is the notion of immediacy, as we have
already seen. Let us take it as our guiding notion too, so much as it is the
first point of intercourse between Sellars and Hegel.
The framework of givenness is tied predominantly in Sellars to the
immediacy of the experience. The Myth of the Given, writes Sellars, implies
“the possibility of a direct account of immediate experience.”16 Let us start
with the notion of “experience.”
JSP 26.4_05_Selivanov.indd 681 26/10/12 5:26 PM
682 yury selivanov
It should be remarked first that the notion of experience is originally
ambiguous. William James in his own time characterized experience and
everything that is connected with it as “double-barrelled” notions.17 The
same idea was also used by Dewey in his analysis of experience.18 Indeed,
the experience bears the sense of passive suffering, an encounter with
some independent instance that turns us to a state of passivity. On the other
hand, the experience is what we have, what belongs to us, and what makes
us able in some respect. Dewey preferred that last sense of experience. Our
act of reflection reveals a picture of consciousness as something originally
two-sided when we are trying to give an account of it. In this respect the
approach to consciousness presented by the classics of pragmatism exposes
the parallel with the phenomenological approach used by Hegel. We can
also find this double-barreled description of experience and consciousness
in the writings of Hegel:
Consciousness is the definite relation of the Ego to an Object. In so
far as one regards it from the objective side, it can be said to vary
according to the difference of the objects which it has.
. . . At the same time, however, the object is essentially determined (modified) through the mediating relation to Consciousness.
Its diversity is, therefore, to be considered as conversely dependent
upon the development of Consciousness. Their reciprocity continues
through the Phenomenal sphere of Consciousness and leaves the
above-mentioned . . . questions undecided.19
And as we will see, this double-barreled approach is invoked in Sellars’s
critique of consciousness.
When we add “immediate” to the “experience” that does not change
the situation of its ambiguity. The immediate experience means that our
experience stands in some direct, unmediated relation to the independent
instance. At the same time we have experience just because it was given
to us by that instance. And because of this, this very experience becomes
something independent too. It was given to us, and because of that it is
ours. We acquired that experience as the result of our own activity, but at
the same time it was given to us in the way of a gift. That last circumstance
brings about the experience as something of independent cognitive value,
as something not invented by us but acquired.
JSP 26.4_05_Selivanov.indd 682 26/10/12 5:26 PM
the “myth of the given” 683
In the second consideration, the immediate character of the experience
presupposes the same of the consciousness itself; it also appears as given
and immediate, as a given capacity to have the immediate data of experience
and to give an immediate account of their presence. The givenness of consciousness reflects the givenness of the data, what is given. The classics of
empiricism, says Sellars, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume, “take for granted that
the human mind has an innate ability to be aware of certain determinate
sorts— . . . simply by virtue of having sensations and images.”20 But it
should be noted that in classical empiricism the capacity to have data stands
by itself and has nothing in common with the given data, does not mediate
their presence, and hence stands in the same immediate relation to them.
Thus we have the experience as constituted by two main factors, both
of them seem independent of each other, yet in their intercourse the experience is born as something that embraces them both: and here we are at
the root of the classical philosophical dilemma of active and passive, of
form and content, of the rational capacity to condense, on one side, and
the empirical material it has to digest, on the other side. Sellars uses both
these features in his characterization of the classical philosophical tradition
concerning the Myth of the Given. The capacity itself as well as its material or content are supposed to be in the same measure given or acquired
as a gift. The purity and innocence with which we address the sensuous
data are reflected in the immediateness and sincerity with which the data
address us. Russell, one of the representatives of the classical empirical
tradition, gives us in his autobiographical notes a very vivid description of
the feelings of a thinker who breaks free from the tenets of Hegelian idealism and as a prodigal son returns to the realistic Eden: “I felt it, in fact, as
a great liberation, as if I had escaped from a hot-house on to a wind-swept
headland. . . . In the first exuberance of liberation, I became a naïve realist
and rejoiced in the thought that grass is really green, in spite of the adverse
opinion of all philosophers from Locke onwards. I have not been able to
retain this pleasing faith in its pristine vigour, but I have never again shut
myself up in a subjective prison.”21
First of all, it gives relief because it delivers us from the responsibility
(or commitments, as Sellars and after him Brandom would say) for the
experience; it appears as given in its content as in its given direct relations
to the outer world. We face here the idea of an instance that at the same
time belongs to us, to our experience, and yet it exists as an independent
instance: it was given to us and yet by someone else who is responsible for
JSP 26.4_05_Selivanov.indd 683 26/10/12 5:26 PM
684 yury selivanov
that material. That is the idea of “sense-data,” which we find in Russell and
many other representatives of classical empiricism. That makes it possible
for Sellars to concentrate in his analysis of the given upon the givenness of
sense-data in the first place. Of course there is another side of all this connected with the givenness of consciousness and the theme of intellectual
intuition, but we have to put it aside for the time being and concentrate as
Sellars does on sense-data and their critique.
These sense-data are present in our consciousness as special and privileged witnesses. We cannot ignore or doubt them because they witness for
themselves and not for another: Their absolutely reliable certainty is granted
because they express their own presence; their authority is beyond doubt
because we place every authority in the subject matter upon them and consider them as witnesses and as judges at the same time. We act as if under
the spell of the irresistible charm of their sincerity and openness and let the
sense-data play two roles simultaneously: the role of a witness and the role of
a judge in their own case. Our immediate certainty is based on their givenness (to our senses), and their givenness is based on the immediacy of our
account of them or our experience. Here we face the ambiguity of experience
discussed above and exposed by Hegel, the pragmatists, and now Sellars.
The sense-data realize their authority when they claim to be the foundation of our empirical knowledge and at the same time to be independent
of any other knowledge. It is posed as granted that sense consciousness
deals with its own source—namely, the unsynthesized manifold of sensory
intuition, the raw material of our senses—and at the same time is free from
intrusion from the side by the activity of understanding or reason, hence
independent of notions and concepts.
This combined claim forms the very essence of the Myth of the Given.
The Myth of the Given, according to Sellars, presupposes the proposition “that empirical knowledge rests on a ‘foundation’ of non-inferential
knowledge of matter of fact.”22 The fact of sensuous data being rendered
into the fact of possessing empirical knowledge makes the assumption
of their independent and given character crucial for the process of constituting our knowledge. It is essential for the Myth of the Given to state
that empirical knowledge “stands on its own feet”;23 obviously enough,
such feet are sense-data. Or as Sellars puts it in another place, “The
authority of Konstatierungen [observational reports] rests on nonverbal
episodes of awareness.”24 Besides that, the authority of the sense-data
rests on their independence and on their self-sufficiency in respect to the
JSP 26.4_05_Selivanov.indd 684 26/10/12 5:26 PM
the “myth of the given” 685
concepts of our mind. This independence from conceptual knowledge is
also stressed by Sellars as the distinguishing feature of the Myth of the
Given: the “fact is non-inferentially known” and “presupposes no other
knowledge.”25 Our sense content does not involve a “process of concept
formation.”26
Because of this the main target of Sellars’s critique will be the independence of our empirical knowledge and the self-reliability of its foundation in sense-data. Sellars draws our attention to the apparent contradiction
lying at the bottom of this framework.
This traditional account of the foundation of empirical knowledge
reveals the inconsistency that lies at the very bottom of it. Sellars writes
about the leap that we have to make while moving from the nonverbal and
uninferred episodes of consciousness to the verbal contestations of facts
and observational reports.
The Myth of the Given implies three main propositions that work as
the mechanism of the myth and maintain its role as the foundation of our
empirical knowledge, and as Sellars tries to demonstrate, they cannot be
taken as a substantial and consistent theory as a whole but only partially. In
each case we can preserve a pair of propositions but not the three of them
at once. Some of them have always to be withdrawn to reach consistency.
These three propositions are as follows:
A. X senses red sense content s entails x noninferentially knows that s is red.
[Let us call it the independence thesis.]
B. The ability to sense sense contents is unacquired. [We can call it the
immediacy thesis.]
C. The ability to know facts of the form x is Φ is acquired. [Let us call it the
knowledge thesis.]27
The three propositions are based on three main notions: the first
is the notion of perception and sense-data; the second is the notion of
 acquiredness/unacquiredness or, which is the same in this context,
 immediatedness/mediatedness; and the third is the notion of knowledge,
meaning conceptual knowledge. The interrelations among these three
notions determine the impossibility of their working in accord. Let us look
at them more closely with Sellars.
We can sacrifice the independence thesis, discard the idea of some
independent empirical knowledge, and then combine the remaining two
JSP 26.4_05_Selivanov.indd 685 26/10/12 5:26 PM
686 yury selivanov
in the way classical metaphysical rationalism did in Leibniz and Wolff.
We will treat the sensuous data as just something vague and confused,
something in need of conceptual activity to turn into knowledge—the
beginning of knowledge necessarily, the point zero of it, but never knowledge as it is and should be, namely, rational activity in concepts by our
reason. As a second option, we can give up the knowledge thesis, and
then we will have something in the way of classical empiricism, always
reducing our rational, conceptual activity to the level of sensuous data.
And in the last option, we can sacrifice the immediacy thesis. In that
case the notion of mediatedness or acquiredness will serve as a mediating term, connecting our empirical activity with the level of conceptual
knowledge. Obviously here the Myth of the Given poses itself as the main
obstacle. And therefore thesis B, the immediacy thesis, is the main target
of Sellars’s critique.
Before we proceed, we can note that Sellars’s attitudes toward these
three propositions are essentially different. His main critical target is of
course the thesis of immediacy. As to the material of our senses as independent source, as stated in the independence thesis, Sellars’s attitude is
more moderate. We do not have to get rid of them or demolish them but
only reformulate them in order to free them from the authority of the Myth
of the Given. As Sellars stresses in another place: “This story will amount
to a sense-datum theory only in a sense which robs this phrase of an entire
dimension of its traditional epistemological force.”28
As for thesis C, the knowledge thesis, Sellars seems to be most assured
about it and apparently apt to use it as the basis for his own approach to
the problem. Naturally enough, having in mind to undermine the Myth of
the Given lying at the foundation of metaphysical tradition, Sellars needs to
achieve some other platform from which to develop his critical attack. What
Sellars says later in the text about knowledge reveals that point of departure
or his own position in the theory of knowledge.
The most often quoted excerpt from the Sellars monograph is really
important and is worth not only quoting but a commentary as well. Here
it is: “The essential point is that in characterizing an episode or a state as
that of knowing, we are not giving an empirical description of that episode
or state; we are placing it in the logical space of reasons, of justifying and
being able to justify what one says.”29
This is really one of the most important phrases in Sellars’s work
because it expresses the standpoint of Sellars himself. Let us note that
JSP 26.4_05_Selivanov.indd 686 26/10/12 5:26 PM
the “myth of the given” 687
here Sellars not only distances himself from the traditional approach to
 empirical knowledge or the framework of givenness but clearly distances
himself from the empirical approach as a particular position in the theory
of knowledge, in epistemology. He stresses here that even if our knowledge
can be empirical, that fact does not mean that this knowledge itself is given
to us empirically or that the empirical knowledge is an empirical fact itself
in our theory of knowledge. Hence empirical knowledge cannot be viewed
as self-sufficient on the fact that it is empirical or on the fact of its presence
in our mind. Here Sellars draws a distinction between the empirical content of knowledge and the form of it, which is not necessary empirical and
does not have to be empirical. Accordingly, only after making that “epistemic,” as Sellars puts it, statement can we ask a question: In what measure
is our empirical knowledge justified, and what is the source and basis of its
justification? Here it becomes obvious that Sellars discards the empirical
approach in epistemology and makes a step in the opposite direction, in
the direction of transcendental idealism or German idealism in general. In
order to demonstrate this let us compare Sellars’s thesis with Kant’s discussion from The Critique of Pure Reason. Kant writes as follows: “For internal
experience in general and its possibility, or perception in general, and its
relation to other perceptions, unless some particular distinction or determination thereof is empirically given, cannot be regarded as empirical cognition, but as cognition of the empirical, and belongs to the investigation of
the possibility of every experience, which is certainly transcendental.”30 The
two thinkers meet each other in their mutual approach to the problem of
empirical knowledge, which distinguishes between the “empirical description” or “empirical cognition” in Kant and the “cognition of empirical,”
which ushers us into the transcendental position in epistemology.
This is clearly a Kantianism in Sellars but not, as we will see, the final
step by Sellars. As Sellars himself puts it somewhere, where Kant is, Hegel
is not far. And Richard Bernstein advises us to look deeper into Sellars’s
work and discover Hegelian themes in it.31 This Kantianism is only a transitory position in Sellars’s thought because his own “psychological nominalism” leads us from transcendental standpoint to a wider position that
bases itself upon the linguistic approach to consciousness. It allows Sellars
to show consciousness out from its inner individual and subjective area
and in the open intersubjective area of language activity. At that point he
leaves Kant with his individualistic, transcendental reason for the open
space of reasons. As in Hegel we meet with the sociality of reason embodied
JSP 26.4_05_Selivanov.indd 687 26/10/12 5:26 PM
688 yury selivanov
in language as the Dasein of the Geist, so likewise in Sellars’s statement:
“All awareness of sorts, resemblances, facts, etc., in short, all awareness of
abstract entities—indeed, all awareness even of particulars—is a linguistic
affair.”32 And commentaries on Sellars orientate us too in the Hegelian
direction. Brandom writes in his commentary on Sellars’s work: “Sellars is
proposing a linguistic, social theory of awareness. . . . in the sense of sapience, not of sentience,” of “conceptual awareness.”33 Rorty again is even
more positive in his statement: Sellars offers “us a linguistified version of
Hegel, one in which changes in vocabulary and in inferential relationships
between sentences constitute the growth of Spirit’s self-consciousness.”34
And now we can turn to the comparison between the considerations by
Sellars and those by the author of The Phenomenology of Spirit.
Sellars begins his analysis of sensuous cognition with an invitation to
consider it through three situations as follows:
(a) Seeing that x, over there, is red
(b) Its looking to one that x, over there, is red
(c) Its looking to one as though there were a red object over there.35
Obviously enough these three situations differ from each other in one serious aspect. They all endorse the fact of empirical cognition described in
(a) in different measure. The first phrase gives it the full support. The second
one, (b), is in doubt about whether there is really a red object. The third one,
(c), begins to doubt about whether there is any object at all. Nevertheless, as
Sellars points out, all three of them possess the same propositional content,
namely, the fact of seeing something red, whatever else it may be.36 What
makes a difference among them is the measure of endorsement. Taking
all three together we can look at them as the process of self-testing on the
side of sensuous consciousness. And here we discover the first parallel with
Hegel’s analysis of sense certainty in The Phenomenology of Spirit.
Hegel begins his critique of sensuous consciousness too with the process of its self-testing in response to the questioning from the phenomenologist. This process of self-testing in Hegel takes the same steps as in Sellars.
First, the sensuous consciousness is absolutely sure about its seeing the red
object, then it begins to doubt its quality of redness, and then it doubts its
being an object, a thing at all. That is how Hegel depicts this process in
Phenomenology of Spirit: “It is clear that the dialectic of sense- certainty is
nothing else but the simple history of its movement or of its experience,
JSP 26.4_05_Selivanov.indd 688 26/10/12 5:26 PM
the “myth of the given” 689
and sense-certainty itself is nothing else but just this history. That is why
the natural consciousness, too, is always reaching this result, learning from
experience what is true in it; but equally it is always forgetting it and starting the movement all over again.”37 We or the sensuous consciousness in
company with the phenomenologist start with the reflection on redness (in
Sellars’s [b], or whiteness in Hegel):
At first, then, I become aware of the Thing as a One, and have to hold
fast to it in this its true character; if, in the course of perceiving it,
something turns up which contradicts it, this is to be recognized as
a reflection of mine. Now, there also occur in the perception various
properties which seem to be properties of the Thing; but the Thing is
a One, and we are conscious that this diversity by which it would cease
to be a One falls in us. So in point of fact, the Thing is white only to
our eyes, also tart to our tongue, also cubical to our touch, and so on.38
After that the reflection goes on, and the consciousness accepts its
(some object) being a thing as its (consciousness) own “illusion of perception,” as Hegel calls it, and leaves its previous position. As a result the
sensuous thing disappears in Hegel as well as in Sellars’s (c)—“Thus the
singular being of sense does indeed vanish in the dialectical movement
of immediate certainty.”39 But after that the sensuous consciousness can
return again to its previous position and claim its truth again. It jumps
and flickers, changing one point for another, always ready to sacrifice one
of its points just in order to put forward another one instead—“If we look
back on what consciousness previously took, and now takes, responsibility
for, on what it previously ascribed, and now ascribes, to the Thing, we see
that consciousness alternately makes itself, as well as the Thing, into both
a pure many-less One, and into an Also that resolves itself into independent
‘matters,’” writes Hegel.40 And this is the main feature of the sensuous
consciousness while it is in a process of self-testing according to Hegel:
This, course, a perpetual alternation of determining what is true, and
then setting aside this determining, constitutes, strictly speaking, the
steady everyday life and activity of perceptual consciousness, a consciousness which fancies itself to be moving in the realm of truth. It
advances uninterruptedly to the outcome in which all these essential essentialities or determinations are equally set aside; but in each
JSP 26.4_05_Selivanov.indd 689 26/10/12 5:26 PM
690 yury selivanov
single moment it is conscious only of this one determinateness as the
truth, and then in turn of the opposite one. It does indeed suspect
their unessentiality, and to save them from the danger threatening
them it resorts to the sophistry of asserting to be true what it has itself
just declared to be untrue.41
Let us turn to Sellars again. In his three theses, (a), (b), and (c), just as
in Hegel, the sensuous consciousness is allowed to proceed with its course
of self-testing, self-reflection. And the result of it is the same in Hegel and
in Sellars. The sensuous consciousness easily changes its mind, while at
the same time it is always ready to assert any of its previous truths with the
same self-certainty. And here we can discover with Hegel and with Sellars
that the sensuous consciousness is not taking seriously at all this process
of self-testing but, rather, tends to play with its truths, veiling at the same
time and hiding from us its deeper undoubtable truth. That is why Hegel
concludes that we should not follow the sensuous consciousness, with its
play of truths, but have to overcome it at large and proceed to another form
of consciousness that arises at the horizon of perception—to the rational
capacity of understanding. We have to defy not just the partial truths of
sensuous consciousness but sensuous consciousness as a form in total.
Sellars comes to the same conclusion when he asserts, almost in the
way of a paradox, “that it is implied by my account that not only the propositional content, but also the descriptive content of these three experiences
may be identical.”42 This means that all three theses rotate around one and
the same truth of sensuous consciousness, which remains stable, always
defending itself with one part of it but never exposing its truth in whole so
as not to allow us to criticize it profoundly. Therefore it is not enough to
let sensuous consciousness test itself. Only when we take in suspension
the whole truth of sensuous consciousness will we be able to put it to serious questioning. Only when we treat the three theses irrespectively of their
endorsement as containing one general truth, only then will we discover
the core of the Myth of the Given lying at their foundation.
Just like Hegel at the end of his chapter on sense certainty,43 Sellars
turns to the language argument and seeks a linguistic platform for his position on epistemology. His “psychological nominalism” allows him to move
from “looks” and “impressions” and “immediate experiences” and their
endorsement to episodes of consciousness as they are taken neutrally or
irrespectively of their foundation in the Myth of the Given.

the “myth of the given” 691
At this point there are two ways to treat these neutral episodes, says
Sellars. One is to deal with them as theoretical entities. Another one is to
treat them as containing impressions and immediate experiences as their
components; this last one is the way of the Myth of the Given.44 That means
that at this point we are only in the middle of the road with our critique of
the Myth of the Given. In order to crush the myth we have to create another
myth, proclaims Sellars in an almost Nietzschean manner. From this state
of suspension and balance when we face the two alternatives, it is quite
clear we have to break the balance and give our preference not to the “Myth
of the Given” but to the “Myth of Jones.” But that is another large part of
Sellars’s work.
