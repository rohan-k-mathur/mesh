 I. ON REASONING ABOUT VALUES
 WILFRID SELLARS
 I
 i. In spite of strong currents to the contrary,
 perceptual metaphors?intuition, contemplation, in?
 sight?continue to dominate our conception of logical
 and mathematical knowledge. Knowing is knowing
 that, and to know that is to see. Even when metaphors
 from the language of practice are allowed a place in
 the sun, as when we speak of constructing numbers,
 propositions and proofs, the elements are seen to fit
 and the outcome is a structure to be, if not seen, at least
 grasped.
 2. Obviously there is good sense in these metaphors.
 Logical thinking not only inquires but, on occasion,
 achieves. There are, as James put it, perchings as well
 as flights. Contemplation in the ordinary sense may
 not be the pure, unchanging act of the perennial
 philosophy, but it is at least a perceptual consumma?
 tion and is fitted for its metaphorical role.
 3. One sees that contradictory propositions cannot
 both be true. And, in particular cases, this and other
 insights guide our thinking. Is this because we have a,
 perhaps innate, perhaps instilled, dislike for the
 illogical? Is it a contingent matter of fact that we
 prefer "p or not-p" to "p and not-p" ? Or is it, perhaps,
 a synthetic necessary truth that the awareness of
 inconsistency arouses disbelief and stills desires.
 4. However the fact is to be understood, it seems
 clear that there is a real connection between knowing
 logical truths and being disposed positively to believe
 the implications of our beliefs and, negatively not to
 think logically incoherent thoughts.
 5. Of course, any such connection must be a matter
 of "other things being equal" propensities, for many
 different factors enter into the explanation of a.course
 of thought. But if the awareness of logical truth did
 not, as such, exert pressure on the mind and contribute
 to shaping thought, it would be only per accidens that
 we were rational.
 6. These considerations can be expanded to include
 another dimension?one which, I believe, provides a
 vantage point from which to get an over-view of our
 problem. For what is involved is not only the
 awareness of logical truths, but the having of logical
 concepts and the understanding of logical words.
 These, too, imply the above propensities. Bluntly put,
 to understand such words as "and," "or," "not," "if,"
 "then," "all," and "some" is to be disposed to conform
 (ceteris paribus, of course) to the simpler principles of
 elementary logic.
 7. It is obviously true that the meaning of a logical
 word is a function of its contribution to the
 implications of sentences in which it occurs. That this
 is true, at least in part, of the meaning of every word
 may be less obvious, but is certainly of equal
 importance.
 8. Most words contribute specific implications
 pertaining to specific subject matters. Thus the word "bachelor" in
 Jones is a bachelor
 brings it about that this sentence implies
 Jones is unmarried.
 And the attributive "large" in
 Mickey is a large mouse
 brings it about that this sentence implies
 Mickey is large for a mouse.
 9. There are however certain words which, like
 logical words, contribute general kinds of implication
 to the sentences in which they occur. Thus, consider
 the present tense copula in
 There is thunder.
 It brings it about that the sentence implies
 There will have been thunder.
 To "understand the meaning" of these words is to
 "see" these implications, and to have the correspond?
 ing propensities pertaining to inference and belief.
 10. To "see" that
 7>* implies '{?
 is, ceteris paribus, to have the propensity to believe '(?
 if one believes 'P.* But since, if 'P' implies Q,/ "not
 {?" implies "not-/* ", it is equally to have the tendency
 to believe "not-P" if one believes "not-Q,."
 11. Thus to "see" that (P' implies '{? is, in part, to
 have the propensity not to believe both (P* and "not
 (?'?which leaves open the following combinations

 of belief in 7>' or belief in "not-/*," with belief in '??
 or belief in "not-(?'
 believing 7*' and believing '(?
 believing "not-P" and believing '(?
 believing "not-P" and believing "not-Q,-"
 Which of these combinations is realized is not, of
 course, determined by "seeing" the implication.1
 12. For example
 "Zis made of lead" implies "Zis heavy for its size,"
 so that "seeing" this implication, I will have a
 propensity not to believe with respect to a certain object,
 0, that
 0 is made of lead and 0 is not heavy for its size.
 which leaves open for belief,
 i. 0 is made of lead and 0 is heavy for its size
 2. 0 is not made of lead and 0 is heavy for its size
 3. 0 is not made of lead and 0 is not heavy for its size.
 Which of these beliefs I arrive at will be a function of
 other factors, e.g.
 A. I scratch 0 and it looks like lead. I will tend to believe
 in the first alternative.
 B. I heft 0 and it doesn't feel heavy for its size.
 I will tend to believe in the third alternative.
 C. I scratch 0 and it looks like lead ;
 I heft 0 and it doesn't feel heavy for its size.
 I will tend to believe in the second alternative.2
 13. On the other hand, I may have no encounter
 with 0, and no evidence pertaining to its composition
 or specific gravity. In this case if I have any belief
 about 0 connected with "seeing" the above implica?
 tion, it will be that
 0 is not both made of lead and not heavy for its
 size.
 II
 14. The examples I have chosen so far have come
 from discourse directed toward what is the case, as
 contrasted with what ought to be the case?discourse
 about facts as contrasted with values. In this connection
 we have considered
 (a) subject matter independent implications which
 accrue to sentences from logical words.
 (b) subject-matter pervasive implications which accrue
 to sentences from words pertaining to spatial and
 temporal location.
 (c) implications which are tied to specific subject
 matters, as in the example just discussed.
 15. This classification, highly informal, makes no
 claim to be either tidy or complete. Indeed the second
 category was introduced to prepare the way for a
 further category of subject-matter pervasive impli?
 cations?implications which accrue to sentences by
 virtue of the fact that they contain expressions of a
 kind to which I have not yet directed attention, but
 which will be at the center of the stage for the
 remainder of this essay.
 16. Consider the word "would" as it occurs in
 Would that Jones were here !
 It is a word which has a very general function.
 Sentences involving it, as we say, express a wish. In
 using it, one isn't describing an object. Rather, one is,
 in a suitably broad sense, expressing an attitude towards
 some conceivable object or state of affairs.
 17. What are the logical or, should I say, concep?
 tual implications of this word? What implications
 does it contribute to sentences in which it occurs?
 18. In the first place, a person who candidly or
 sincerely says
 Would that Jones were here !
 can be expected, other things being equal, to try to
 bring it about that Jones is here. Thus, if a person
 comes to think it possible to bring it about that Jones
 is here they3 will?other things being equal?attempt
 to do so.
 19. Thus one who sincerely says
 Would that Jones were here!
 and believes that by doing A, Jones's presence can be
 secured, will, other things being equal, do (or try to
 do) A
 20. This, of course, raises the question, What are
 the 'other things' which must be 'equal'? In a sense
 this question is the topic of the argument to follow.
 1 If we also take into account the fact that to "see" that '/*' implies '(?' is also, in part, to have the propensity to believe 'Q,' if one believes
 */*' and to believe "not-P" if one believes "not-{?" then we must also take into account the combinations in which there is an absence of belief
 with respect to either 7" or "not-P" or an absence ofbelief"with respect to either '{? or "not-Q,." Of these 12 possible combinations only two
 conflict with the propensities in question, namely, (a), "believing 7*' and not-believing 'Q,,'" and (b), "not-believing 'not-P* and believing '?0/-Q/"
 Which of the remaining combinations is realized is, again, not determined by "seeing" the implication.
 2 Of course, if I scratch 0 and it looks like lead and heft 0 but it doesn't feel heavy for its size, I just might be on the road to a
 revolutionary disconfirmation of the implication itself.
 3 In this essay, to avoid the awkward 'he/she' I shall use the somewhat idiosyncratic but by no means non-existent construction 'a person
 ... they' and 'one ... they.'

 21. Let us try the following ideas on for size :
 (a) The person must believe that there is a real possibility
 that Jones will be present.
 (b) The person must believe that by doing A they will
 be doing something which contributes to Jones's
 presence.
 (c) The person must have no desire which overrides their
 wish that Jones were here.
 22. The first is connected with the difference
 between a wish and a desire.
 The second is connected with the difference between
 a desire for a state of affairs and the intention to do an
 action which might bring it about.
 The third is connected with the difference between
 what one wishes, some things considered, and what
 one wishes more things considered.
 Let us take up the latter two in order.
 23. We began our discussion of practical implica?
 tions with wishes, which, as such, are conceptually
 remote from action?even though they have a
 conceptual tie with action. As we saw, other things
 being equal, "x wishes that-/>" implies "x tries to bring
 it about that-/?." Let us now turn our attention to
 purposes which are very close to action, thus
 I will take the 4PM flight to Houston today,
 where this expresses an intention, and is not a mere
 prediction. Compare
 Jones will take the 4PM flight to Houston today.
 24. In the former context "will" is a cousin of
 "would that." Its implicative tie with action is to be
 found in the fact that, ceteris paribus,
 Jones candidly says "I will do A in 10 minutes"
 implies
 Jones does A in 10 minutes
 which involves the idea that, ceteris paribus,
 Jones candidly says "I will do A right now9'
 implies
 Jones does A right now.
 Here "ceteris paribus" guards against the possibility
 that, for example, Jones is paralyzed or about to be
 struck dead, and presumes that A is an action which
 Jones is in a position to do.
 25. Thus we can lay down the principle
 Ceteris paribus, people carry out their here-now
 intentions
 which is a special case of
 Ceteris paribus, people do what they intend to do
 and this, in turn, of
 Ceteris paribus, people realize their purposes.
 Ill
 26. A bit of linguistic regimentation is in order.
 The above use of "will"?the use in which it expresses
 a purpose or intention?is limited in Standard English
 to first person action contexts, thus
 I will do A
 But we can, of course, have intentions which pertain
 to the obtaining of states of affairs other than our own
 actions.
 27. Thus it can be my purpose that my children
 have a good education. Obviously I can wish it :
 Would that my children have a good education.
 But if I think it possible that this state of affairs might
 obtain, I can desire it. Interestingly enough the
 Standard English way of expressing this desire is by
 the use of the auxiliary "shall," thus
 My children shall have a good education
 where this, as before, is no mere prediction, but
 expresses the intention or purpose that this be the
 case. To achieve a uniformity of representation, i.e.
 to avoid a constant shuffle between "will" and "shall,"
 I shall use the auxiliary "shall" in all my examples to
 represent the expression of an intention. After all, it
 is so used in connection with most of the kinds of
 intention in which I shall be interested; and,
 furthermore, "will" in Standard English serves for
 the most part to form the future indicative.
 28. Thus, instead of
 I will do A
 I shall use
 I shall do A
 to bring it in line with
 It shall be the case that my children have a good
 education.
 29. Furthermore, since I am not particularly
 concerned with mere wishes (i.e. with cases in which
 one is "favorably disposed toward a state of affairs"
 but doesn't think that it can be realized, I shall
 concern myself with the logic of intentions, and hence
 with the logic of my regimented "shall"
 30. The most fundamental principle of this logic

 84 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY
 is a reformulation of an earlier point about "will." It
 is to the effect that
 Jones candidly says "I shall do A here and now"
 implies, ceteris paribus,
 Jones does A here and now
 Put more abstractly, the principle affirms a connection
 between
 having intentions to do A here and now
 and
 doings of A.
 31. The next logical feature to be noted concerns
 the connection between the statements
 My children shall have a good education
 My children will have a good education only if I
 put aside money
 and
 I shall put money aside.
 32. Before examining the logic of this sequence in
 depth, let me make an obvious, but nevertheless
 crucially important, point about intentions. It is
 essential to distinguish between the autobiographical
 factual statement
 I intend to do A
 which ascribes an intention to me, as
 Jones intends to do A
 ascribes an intention to Jones, and, on the other hand,
 I shall do A
 which (in our regimented idiolect) expresses that
 intention.
 33. Notice, however, that in the first person case
 the functions of the two sentences overlap. Thus
 I intend to do A
 not merely ascribes an intention to me, but also, for
 reasons familiar to students of Moore's Paradox4
 serves to express it. In the third person case, thus
 He, Jones, intends to do A
 the statement obviously does not express Jones's
 intention to do A. I can express an intention about
 Jones doing A by saying
 Jones shall do A
 which would express my intention that Jones does A,
 and is equivalent to
 It shall be the case that Jones does A.
 34. It is therefore essential to distinguish between
 what is implied by an intention and what is implied by
 the fact that a person has the intention?just as it is
 essential to distinguish between what is implied by a
 belief (i.e. the proposition believed) and what is
 implied by the fact that a person has the belief (believes
 the proposition).
 35. Let us equate for present purposes
 Jones believes that-/*, e.g. that it is raining
 with
 Jones, if in a candid frame of mind, would assent to
 "It is raining" (or its counterpart in Jones's
 idiolect).
 and correspondingly
 Jones intends that-/? be the case, e.g. that his
 children get a good education
 with
 Jones, if in a candid frame of mind, would assent to
 "My children shall get a good education."
 36. Thus we can distinguish between the implica?
 tions of the sentence
 It is raining
 e.g.
 The streets are getting wet
 and the implications of the sentence
 Jones believes that it is raining
 e.g.
 Jones expects to get wet, if he ventures outside
 and, correspondingly, between the implications of the
 sentence
 My children shall get a good education
 e.g.
 My children shall go to college
 and the implications of the sentence
 Jones intends that his children get a good education
 e.g.
 Jones believes that his children are docile.
 4 I.e. The logical oddity of "It is raining, but I don't believe it."

 37- Notice that if one proposition 'P9 implies
 another proposition, *QJ it doesn't follow that a
 person who believes T' also believes '(?/ but only
 that they are subject to criticism on logical grounds if
 they believe 6P ' and either don't believe '(?' or believe
 "not-&."
 38. Similarly if one intention implies another
 intention it doesn't follow that a person who has the
 former also has the latter, but only that they are
 subject to criticism on logical grounds if they have the
 one and don't have the other or have the contradictory
 intention.5
 39. Thus, the intention expressed by
 "I shall eat a healthy diet"
 implies (by virtue of the principles of nutrition)
 "I shall eat complete proteins"
 but a person may very well have the former intention
 without having the latter.
 40. This example calls attention to the fact that
 just as one proposition may imply another without a
 person realizing that it does, so one intention may
 imply another without a person realizing that it does.
 41. Of course, when it comes to actual cases of
 reasoning, the only implications that enter the psycho?
 logical picture are the implications which the reasoner
 takes into account. But from the standpoint of logical
 criticism and evaluation, the implications are what
 they are whether or not the reasoner takes them into
 account.
 IV
 42. With the above distinctions in mind, let us
 return to the main line of the argument.
 43. We were interested in the special implications
 which attach to the word "shall." Of these the most
 basic was that which relates the intention expressed
 by "I shall do A here and now" to action. We can now
 see that this implication relates the having of such an
 intention, to action. Thus
 Jones has the intention to do A here and now
 implies, ceteris paribus,6
 Jones does A here and now.
 Also
 Jones intends to do A in 10 minutes
 implies, ceteris paribus,
 Jones will do A in i o minutes
 (if, e.g. he doesn't change his mind).
 44. From these implications we must distinguish
 those other implications relating to "shall" which
 concern the intentions themselves and not the fact that
 someone has them.
 45. Thus, consider
 My children shall get a good education
 or, in general,
 It shall be the case that-/?.
 Intuitively, this implies.
 I shall {ceteris paribus) do that which contributes to
 bringing it about that my children get a good
 education.
 The "ceteris paribus" is clearly necessary, although its
 exact role remains to be discussed. The crucial point,
 however, which it helps to highlight, is that there is
 a conceptual tie between
 It shall be the case that...
 and
 I shall do ...
 Abstractly put, intentions that something be the case
 imply intentions to do.7
 V
 46 With one exception to be noted in a moment,
 and one possible exception to be considered near the
 end of the argument, these are the implications which
 pertain directly to "shall" and specify what might be
 called its conceptual grammar. Expressions of inten?
 tion have other kinds of implications, but, as we shall
 see, they are grounded in implications between
 indicatives.
 47. The fundamental principle connecting indic?
 ative implications with the logic of "shall" is
 5 Notice that in most contexts in which I refer to intentions, the latter are to be construed as intention candidates or intendibles. The context
 should make it clear whether I am discussing a had intention or a mere intendible. Roughly, intentions stand to intendings as propositions
 to believings.
 6 The qualification is obviously necessary to take into account, for example, the possibility that the actual circumstances prevent Jones
 from doing A, or that he unwittingly becomes paralyzed.
 7 It will shortly become clear that the distinctive feature of such implication lies in the connection between 'It shall be the case that I
 do A' and 'I shall do A.' The remaining features of the above example, including the ceteris paribus clause, reflect the implicative pressures
 which relate one 'shall be the case' to another, i.e. which transcend the distinction between 'shall be' and 'shall do.'

 S-Imp. : if 7" implies 'Q,,' then "It shall be the case
 that-P" implies "It shall be the case that-(T.8
 It is because of this dimension that the logic of
 purposes (and values) is largely derivative from the
 logic of facts.
 48. The fundamental simplicity of this encom?
 passing principle enables me to cover a substantial
 amount of ground by means of a few regimented
 examples. But first a word or two about the nature
 and scope of the principle are in order.
 49. In the first place, implication is to be understood
 as a relation which authorizes inference and, more
 generally, serves as a criterion for the compatibility
 of beliefs and, correspondingly, of intentions, along
 the lines discussed in the opening sections. We noted
 there, without attempting a complete classification,
 that implications may be logical in the narrower
 sense?subject matter independent?or they may
 arise from categorial features of the concepts involved,
 or, as in the case of causal connections, they may be
 tied to specific subject matters. The latter clearly play
 a central role in practical reasoning.
 50. In the last case it is important to distinguish
 between causal implications which are explicitly
 general and can be formulated as lawlike statements,
 and causal implications, which, while presupposing
 the truth of some lawlike statement, do not specify
 these statements?which may not even be at hand.
 Thus we may know that in circumstances like these, 'F'
 causally implies '?? without knowing exactly what it
 is about these circumstances by virtue of which the
 implication obtains.
 51. The task of botanizing implications and the
 ways in which they depend on other items for their
 existence and their knowability is, as I have implied,
 a difficult one. Indeed, it is, to a surprising extent,
 unfinished business. Fortunately, it will be sufficient
 for my purposes to rely on our intuitive sense of which
 matter-of-factual propositions imply which other
 matter-of factual propositions, and concentrate on
 the relation of such matter-of-factual implications to
 practical reasoning.
 VI
 52. Another framework point remains to be made
 which is fundamental to all that follows. It is a point
 which has seemed to many whose judgement I
 respect9 to fly in the face of reason. The implications
 between intentions which arise from ' implications
 pertaining to matters-of fact concern only the content
 of intentions and not their status as intentions.
 53. This thesis is the upshot of the distinctions
 which were drawn in sections III and IV above. It is
 reflected in the fact that, as I shall argue, negation,
 for example, enters into the expression of an intention
 only as part of what is governed by the "shall" rubric.
 54. Thus, in our idiolect, we have
 I shall do A It shall be the case that-/?
 I shall not do A It shall not be the case that-/?10
 but not
 1not-shdAX do A
 It not-sha.ll be the case that-/?
 e.g.
 My children not-shall have a good education.
 55. If we regiment
 I shall do A
 as
 Shall [I do A]
 and
 It shall be the case that-/?11
 as
 Shall be [p]
 then we would have negations
 Shall [I not do A]
 and
 Shall be [not-/?]
 but not
 Not-shall [ I do A]
 nor
 Not shall be [/?].
 56. To generalize this claim, before submitting it
 8 This principle can be formulated as a biconditional, but I forbear to do so lest I open the door to misunderstandings, based on other
 things I have written, which there would be no time to alleviate.
 9 I have particularly in mind Bruce Aune and Hector Casta?eda, who have repeatedly taken me to task on this matter.
 10 For our purposes, "It shall not be the case that-/>" is equivalent to "It shall be the case that not-p" Problems which concern the relation
 between "It is true that not-p" and "It is not true that-/>" which arise in connection with the distinction between the Principle of Bi-Valence
 and the Principle of Excluded Middle have no bearing on the problem to be discussed concerning a possible double occurrence of
 negation in expressions of intention.
 11 Note that the construction "It shall be the case that-/>" takes advantage of the logical equivalence of'/>' and "It is the case that-/>" to
 permit "shall" to exhibit its role of auxiliary verb, which "Shall [/>]" does not do.

 ON REASONING ABOUT VALUES 87
 to closer scrutiny, logical operators do not occur
 outside expressions of intention, or, to put it in other
 words, expressions of intention do not occur within
 the scope of logical constants and quantifiers. Thus
 we do not have
 Shall be [/?] or shall be [q]
 as contrasted with
 Shall be [/? or q]
 nor
 For all x, shall be [if x is a future danger, then I will
 escape x]
 as contrasted with
 Shall be [for all x, if x is a future danger, then I will
 escape x].
 57. This conceptual point is not a consequence of
 the fact that expressions of intention are neither true
 nor false for, as I pointed out in "Thought and
 Action,"12 they do have the semantical values, realized
 and not-realized depending on whether the correlated
 expression of belief is true or false. The fact, however,
 that they have these semantical values does nothing to
 counter the idea that an expression of intention as an
 expression of intention can only be negative by virtue of
 having a negative content. "Not-shall [ I do A]" is false
 in the radical sense of conceptually incoherent. The
 fact, when it is a fact, that my intention to do A is not
 realized does not make the (nonsensical) 'not-shall [I
 do il]' true.13
 58. It is time, now, to take into account a fact
 which seems to make nonsense of the above claim. I
 have in mind the obvious fact that expressions of
 intention can occur in a text along with other
 expressions of intention and, indeed, with declarative
 sentences which are expressions of belief.
 59. Again, is it not a fact that
 I intend to do A and I intend to do B
 makes perfectly good sense? If so, should not
 Shall [I do A] and shall [I do B]
 also make good sense. But the former makes sense qua
 conjunction of "I intend to do A" and "I intend to do
 B" in their intention ascribing roles (see paragraph 33
 above). It by no means follows that the same is true
 when they are replaced by primary expressions of
 intention.
 60. Another possible source of confusion is the fact
 that the punctuated text
 My children shall have a good education.
 I have already begun to put money aside,
 can easily be confused with the conjunctive statement
 My children shall have a good education and I have
 already begun to put money aside.
 The latter would be a prima facie counter-example to
 the thesis I have been advancing.
 61. Can it seriously be maintained that the only
 sound conjunctive expression in the neighborhood
 has the form
 Shall be [/? and q]?
 62. To see why the answer is Yes, it is necessary to
 reflect on a feature of ordinary logic which is so
 familiar that it is treated with contempt : Conjunction
 Introduction (CI).
 63. I called attention above to the distinction
 between a text and a conjunction. An example of a
 text would be
 The weather was clear. The temperature was low.
 Here there is punctuation but no logical connective, no
 "and." We have two sentences rather than one
 conjunctive sentence. CI tells us that
 '/>' and V together imply '/? and q.9
 It is a principle of implication which takes one from
 separate sentences to a single conjunctive sentence.
 64. Thus the above text implies the conjunction
 The weather was clear and the temperature was
 low.
 65. In the opening paragraphs of this essay I
 commented on the connection of logical concepts and
 implications with propensities to believe and not to
 believe, and on the pressures they exert in the
 direction of coherence and the absence of inconsis?
 tency. In CI we find a related pressure, this time one
 which constrains us to bring together statements and
 beliefs which, though they coexist, are not confronting
 one another, and combine them into a functional
 unity in which they rub shoulders; into a single
 12 In Keith Lehrer, ed., Freedom and Determinism, New York, 1966.
 13 We shall see, towards the end of the argument, that there is a place for another pair of values for expressions of intention, namely
 reasonable and unreasonable, but this neither requires nor permits an external negation.

 Statement or belief whose implications can be drawn
 in accordance with logical principles.14
 66. Before discussing the bearing of CI on practical
 reasoning, on reasoning about purposes and values,
 one more principle which concerns an implication
 tied directly to "shall" (in my idiolect) remains to be
 introduced.
 So-Be-It: "Shall be [cp]" and '/?' imply "Shall be
 [cp and /?]" where 'cp' is a formula which may or
 may not be logically complex.
 Implications conforming to this principle push in the
 direction of getting relevant beliefs into the scope of
 our purposes and intentions, and hence into the scope
 of practical reasoning.15
 67. Notice that So-be-it requires that
 Shall be [I will do A]
 where "will" is the Standard "shall," not have the
 same sense as
 Shall [I do A].
 My doing A in the future can enter into an intention
 either as a target16 of an intention or, via So Be It, as
 something which I believe will happen, as when,
 confronted by a highwayman, I believe, fatalistically,
 that I will hand over my money. A similar distinction
 might be drawn between
 Shall be [my lawn will be mowed]
 and
 Shall be [my lawn be mowed]
 where the infinitive indicates that this content is not
 present in the intention by virtue of So-be-it. But
 these niceties would not contribute to the solution of
 the problems with which I am concerned.
 68. These considerations support the principle
 Shall-Be: "Shall [I do A]" implies "Shall be [I do
 A]."
 Note that this infinitive phrase " I do A" presents the
 action as up to one, and not, like "Shall be [I will do
 A], "sub specie So-Be-It. Thus, the converse of Shall-Be
 as formulated above is also true, which it would not
 be if the implicate were "Shall be [I will do A]." It is
 Shall-Be which, together with S-IMP underwrites the
 intuition expressed in paragraph 45 above.
 69. It might be thought that the distinction
 between what I intend to do and what I believe I will do
 is "merely psychological." This is of a piece with
 claiming that in general the distinction between
 believing and intending is "merely psychological." It
 is the "merely," of course, which is out of place. Is the
 difference between expecting ("It will rain") and
 retrospecting ("It did rain") "merely psychological"?
 or are there conceptual points to be made about tenses ?
 Clearly the latter, and this is the parallel on which I
 have insisted.
 70. As for CI, in practical contexts, it is simply a
 consequence of the above basic principle, where this
 has been generalized to cover the implications of two
 or more sentences, thus
 If TV TV ... TV together imply '?,' then
 "Shall be [P,]," "Shall be [P2]," ... "Shall be [Pn]"
 together imply "Shall be [QJ"
 In the case of CI we would have
 TV '*Y 'Pn9 together imply <PX and P2 and ...
 and Pn9
 hence
 "Shall be [PA," "Shall be [P2]," . . . "Shall be [/>?]"
 together imply "Shall be [Px andP2 .. . and Pn]"
 VII
 71. The fact that So-be-it involves the introduction
 of beliefs into the contents of intentions calls for a
 review of our regimented formulation of intendibles.
 72. One must distinguish between those constitu?
 ents of a complex intendible which are there merely
 as, so to speak, factual connective tissue, i.e. items
 which one who adopts the intention believes to be the
 14 There are also the pressures and constraints of relevance, about which much would have to be said to get significantly above the
 intuitive level. If I engage in hand-waving in introducing a pressure of relevance, I am at least in good company.
 15 It is important not to confuse the concept ofintention with that of desire or motive. A state of affairs can be a constituent of an intention
 without being an object of desire or a source of motivation. For an examination of key topics pertaining to the relations between the
 concepts desire, intention, and satisfaction, see my "Thought and Action" in Lehrer (ed.) Freedom and Determinism, New York 1966. See
 particularly Section III.
 16 Roughly speaking, the target of an intention is that which is being viewed sub specie "up to me." For an elaboration of this distinction
 see "Some Reflections on Contrary to Duty Imperatives," Nous 1, 1967, pp. 315 ff. For its application to an argument of Castaneda's, see
 "Volitions Re-affirmed," Action Theory, ed. by Myles Brand and Douglas Walton (Dordrecht, 1976), p. 62. For a caveat on degrees of up
 to-me-ness, see paragraph 82 below.

 ON REASONING ABOUT VALUES 89
 case, and those constituents which constitute the target
 of the intention, i.e. the presence of which makes it an
 intention.
 73. One might think that the distinction in
 question coincides with that between items which are
 present as sources of motivation, either positive or
 negative, and items which are motivationally neutral.
 But that would be a mistake.
 74. In the first place, a constituent of a scenario
 can be something that is believed to be the case and
 yet be directly relevant to a preference between that
 scenario and its alternatives, thus
 Shall be [.. .Jones has insulted me and if I see him,
 I frown ...]
 and
 Shall be [.. .Jones has insulted me and if I see him,
 I smile ...]
 75. And in the second place, one wants to allow
 for the possibility that one and the same intention can
 be carried out for different motives. This requires a
 way of representing intentions which abstract as far
 as possible from the distinction between motivating
 and non-motivating factors.
 76. We must distinguish between questions con?
 cerning the nature and logic of intentions, and
 questions concerning the explanation of why a person
 adopts a certain intention or prefers one course of
 events to another.
 77. Of course, the representation of an intention
 can be combined with a representation of motiva?
 tional structure by the use of such words and phrases
 as "in order to," "in spite of " and "because"?thus,
 Shall be [I do A in order to bring about X, in spite
 of the fact that X would also bring about Y, because
 X would enable me to do B].
 78. What we are looking for is a way of represent?
 ing complex intentions which abstract from the
 structure introduced by such words and phrases.
 79. From this point of view, the basic distinction
 between intention-factors is that between those which
 are viewed sub specie "up-to-me," and those which are
 viewed as given, i.e. those items which are there by
 virtue of So-be-it. And this distinction can be
 represented grammatically by using verbs in the
 infinitive for the former, and statement-making
 sentential forms for the latter, thus
 Shall be [I do A]17
 as contrasted with
 Shall be [. .. and I will do A]
 and
 Shall be [my lawn be mowed]
 as contrasted with
 Shall be [... and my lawn will be mowed].
 80. Notice that in each case the So-be-it item is
 introduced by ".. . and." This is because every
 intention must have at least one "up-to-me"
 constituent.
 81. The "up-to-me"-ness of intendible constituents
 can be made explicit by prefixing them with the
 conditional "if it is up to me," thus
 Shall be [if it is up to me, I do A]
 Shall be [if it is up to me, my lawn be mowed].
 This antecedent would get affirmed by virtue of So
 be-it.
 82. Problems concerning the criteria for determin?
 ing what is up to an agent and, perhaps, to what
 degree or extent are notoriously difficult. Fortunately
 (like issues pertaining to probability) they do not
 bear on the central topics of this paper?so I simply
 look them in the face and move on.
 VIII
 83. We are now off and running. With the
 principles already presented (along with constraints
 of relevance) we have a logical pressure to bring our
 separate intentions together with our separate beliefs
 into one picture or scenario. Thus consider the text,
 I shall go downtown tomorrow, if the weather is
 clear. The weather will be clear. If the weather is
 clear, the streets will be crowded. If the streets are
 crowded, I will be miserable.
 This text implies, by virtue of Shall-Be, So-be-it and
 CI, the conjunctive intention
 17 Notice that the entire conditional
 If I do A, I will be punished
 is a statement-making form, and hence is appropriately changed into an intention by So-be-it, thus
 Shall be [... If I do A, I will be punished].

 90 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY
 Shall be [I go downtown tomorrow, if the weather
 is clear and the weather will be clear and if the
 weather is clear, the streets will be crowded and if
 the streets are crowded, I be miserable].
 84. Notice that of the contents of this intention,
 "If the weather is clear tomorrow, I go downtown" is
 present as an intendible derived by CI from the
 conditional intention at the beginning of the text,
 whereas "if the weather is clear, the streets will be
 crowded" is a propositional constituent via So-be-it.
 Notice also that while "if the streets are crowded, I
 will be miserable" is introduced as a whole via So-be
 it, its consequent is represented as an intendible state of
 affairs as being "up to me."
 85. The above conjunctive intention, in turn,
 implies, by three subordinate uses of Modus Ponens,
 the intention
 Shall be [I go downtown tomorrow and be
 miserable].
 I ask myself if I accept this intention. If I reject it, I
 am logically committed to rejecting either
 Shall be [I go downtown tomorrow]
 or
 Shall be [I be miserable tomorrow].
 Presumably I will reject the former.
 86. Notice that I can also ask myself
 Is it really true that if the streets are crowded and
 I am there, I will be miserable?
 and decide, on reflection, No; in which case that
 conjunct drops out and I am left with
 Shall be [I go downtown tomorrow if the weather
 is clear and the weather will be clear and if the
 weather is clear, the streets will be crowded]
 which implies
 Shall be [I go downtown tomorrow and the streets
 will be crowded]
 which, in turn implies, by simplification,
 Shall be [I go downtown tomorrow]
 and, finally, since "shall be" is no longer serving to
 embrace So-be-it factors,
 Shall [I go downtown tomorrow]
 which, if I accept it, is the intention to go downtown
 tomorrow.
 87. Notice that it might occur to me as relevant
 that when my friend Jones is with me I am happy,
 even though the circumstances are otherwise unpleas?
 ant. Thus, even if I retain my belief that if the streets
 are crowded and I am there I will be unhappy in the
 weaker form
 If the streets are crowded, and I am there, then,
 other things being as expected, I will be unhappy.
 I now see that other things are not equal in that
 If the streets are crowded and Jones is with me, I
 will not be unhappy.
 88. At this point I may wish and, indeed, if the
 situation can be realized, intend that Jones be with
 me tomorrow. Furthermore, I may believe that Jones
 will be with me if and only if I invite him. So-be-it
 takes me to
 Shall be [Jones be with me and Jones will be with
 me if and only if I invite him]
 I am confronted by the choice
 Shall be [I invite Jones and he be with me] ?
 Shall be [I not invite Jones and ht not be with me] ?
 If I opt for the former, simplification takes me to
 Shall be [I invite Jones]
 and, hence, by Shall-be (converse), to
 Shall [I invite Jones].
 89. The fact that I intend to invite him implies, by
 virtue of the basic principle pertaining to "shall"
 (paragraph 43), that ceteris paribus I will in point of
 fact invite him. Believing that other things are in fact
 equal, I can be expected to believe that I will invite
 him, and, hence, to believe that if I go downtown,
 Jones will be with me. So-be-it inserts this into the
 intention matrix as follows,
 Shall be [If the weather is clear, I go downtown
 tomorrow and the weather will be clear and if the
 weather is clear, the streets will be crowded and if
 I go downtown, Jones will be with me and if the
 streets are crowded and Jones is with me, I be
 happy]
 which implies
 Shall be [I go downtown tomorrow and be happy]
 which in turn implies
 Shall [I go downtown tomorrow].
 90. Of course, if I learn that Jones will not be able
 to accompany me, the question

 ON REASONING ABOUT VALUES 91
 Shall [I go downtown tomorrow] ?
 will be reopened?unless I am bored by the whole
 business.
 91. The example we have been considering should
 remind us that an essential feature of practical
 reasoning is the fact that it constantly involves an
 appeal to preference.18 This occurs when one is
 confronted by alternatives, thus
 Shall I do A?
 Shall I do B?
 e.g.
 Shall I eat the yogurt?
 Shall I eat the ice cream sundae ?
 92. The following relevant considerations occur to
 me
 The yogurt is plain. Plain yogurt is blah.
 The yogurt has less calories.
 The ice cream sundae is very fattening.
 The ice cream sundae is very tasty.
 CI and So-be-it expand the content of the above
 alternatives, thus
 Shall be [I eat the plain blah yogurt with few
 calories] ?
 Shall be [I eat the tasty ice cream sundae which is
 very fattening] ?
 93. Confronted by these alternatives I may opt for
 one or the other, in which case that is my preference
 on the occasion. Or I may remain in a state of
 indecision, casting about for other alternatives or
 additional relevant considerations pertaining to the
 alternatives at hand. Thus it may occur to me that I
 have to work in the garden tomorrow, and so can
 stand a few more calories. The above alternative
 becomes
 Shall be [I eat the plain blah yogurt with few
 calories which I shall more than use up in the
 garden tomorrow] ?
 Shall be [I eat the tasty ice cream sundae which,
 though very fattening in general, will not fatten me
 since I will use the calories up tomorrow working
 in the garden] ?
 The choice of the ice cream sundae is now humanly
 predictable. I opt for the latter alternative, which
 implies
 Shall be [I eat the ice cream sundae]
 and, hence,
 Shall [I eat the ice cream sundae].
 94. Thus CI together with So-be-it, takes our
 separate purposes and relevant beliefs and puts them
 together into encompassing alternatives :
 1. Shall be [I do A at t, which means that...] ?
 2. Shall be [I do B at t, which means that...] ?
 3. Shall be [I do Cat t, which means that...] ?
 The successive steps are
 (a) elaboration by CI and So-be-it, and the
 drawing of implications
 (b) choice, e.g. (2), or, continuing indecision
 (c) simplification. Shall be [I do B at t]
 (d) intention to act. Shall [I do B at t]
 which, when time t comes (and I do not change my
 mind), generates a doing (or an attempt to do) B.
 95. This picture is one according to which practical
 reasoning is essentially the process of elaborating
 alternative scenarios for a choice.
 96. The elaboration is "rational." What about the
 choice? Is there any sense in which the choice can be
 "rational" over and above that in which it is so by
 virtue of being a choice between rationally elaborated
 alternatives, i.e. in which relevant considerations and
 relevant implications have been taken into account ?
 Let me postpone this question until I have explored
 another line of thought.
 IX
 97. We have been considering implications be?
 tween purposes or intentions
 Ii implies I2
 where Ix is, for example, "Shall be [I go downtown
 tomorrow, if the weather is clear, and the weather
 will be clear]" and I2, "Shall be [I go downtown
 tomorrow]." The implication tells us that the
 combination
 Accepting Ix and not accepting I2 (or accepting the
 contradictory)
 is unreasonable. Thus the combination
 accepting "Shall be [I go downtown tomorrow, if
 it is clear and it will be clear]" and not accepting
 18 For a more detailed account of preference, see "Thought and Action" in Keith Lehrer (ed.), Freedom and Determinism, especially pp.
 113 ff. and pp. 131 ff. The role of CI was smuggled in under the name "the summative phrase." I there emphasize?which I do not here?
 that the summative phrase constructs alternatives each of which includes the implications of not choosing the others.

 "Shall be [I go downtown tomorrow]" (or accept?
 ing "Shall be [I not go downtown tomorrow]")
 is subject to logical criticism.
 98. But, of course, the fact that the implication
 tells us that this combination is unreasonable tells me
 nothing about the reasonableness or unreasonableness
 of accepting Ix or of accepting I2.
 99. The implication, however, can be interpreted
 as telling us that accepting
 "Shall [I go downtown tomorrow]"
 is reasonable relative to accepting
 "Shall be [I go downtown tomorrow, if it is clear
 and it will be clear]."
 Relative reasonableness, however, is not what we were
 looking for when asking our postponed question.
 What we had in mind was rather a reasonableness
 which is not in the above way relative?and which
 we might be tempted to characterize either as
 "absolute" or as "intrinsic."19 Can we find it? Let us
 follow Hume's example and beat about in the
 neighboring fields.
 100. What is the relation between
 I shall do A
 and
 I ought to do A (or J should do A) ?
 The answer to this question must surely run somewhat
 as follows : The latter makes a positive assessment of
 the intention expressed by the former.
 101. Since to make a "positive assessment" of
 something amounts to characterizing it as in some
 sense good, and since there is clearly some sort of
 conceptual tie between "good" and "ought" (or
 "should"), as illustrated by the truistic feel of "one
 ought (or should) choose the good," the first fruit of
 our beating would seem to be that if we can get a grip
 on "ought" or "should," we might get a grip on
 "good," and, perhaps, on our "absolute" or "intrinsic"
 reasonableness as well.
 102. Consider the statement
 If Jones wants X, he should (ought to) do A
 Clearly the underlying theme is that given Jones's
 circumstances, C, and a proper spelling out of just
 what it is that Jones wants,
 "Jones gets X" implies "Jones does A"
 or, equivalently,
 "Jones's getting X" implies "Jones's doing A, if
 Jones is in C"
 because, for example, a person's doing A is causally
 necessary for their getting X, if they are in C.
 103. Suppose that Jones does want X, i.e. his
 purpose or intention is to get X; can we reason
 If Jones wants X, he should (ought to) do A, since
 he is in C
 Jones wants X
 So, Jones should (or ought to) do A ?
 If so, we would have arrived at a positive evaluation of
 Jones's doing A from a. factual premise (Jones "wants
 X") together with a premise the gist of which is a
 causal connection between an outcome and an action.
 In other words we would ostensibly have derived a
 value from matters of fact, an ought from ?yes.
 104. But, of course, this is an illusion. We have
 simply run into another case of relative reasonable?
 ness. The hypothetical proposition
 If Jones wants X, he ought to do A, if in C
 which is based on, but not identical with, the causal
 implication in question, tells us that
 "Shall [I, Jones, get X]" implies "Shall [I, Jones, do
 ,4 if in q"
 i.e. that the intention
 "Shall [I, Jones, do A, if in C\"
 is reasonable relative to the intention
 "Shall [I, Jones, get X]"
 by virtue of the implication
 a person's getting X implies their doing A if in C.
 105. Thus, given that Jones wants X, i.e. intends
 "Shall [I get X]" all we are entitled to conclude is that
 "Shall [I, Jones, do A]"
 is implied by and hence reasonable relative to an
 intention which Jones actually has. But, again, this is
 not what we were looking for?though it may be all
 we can get. Nothing is implied about a "non-relative"
 reasonableness of getting X. In spite of the "oughts"
 and "shoulds" there is not the ghost of a hint as to how
 the intention to get X might be "non-relatively"
 reasonable.
 19 These two tags are, of course, provisional, for until we clarify the concept of relative reasonableness, it remains unclear what it is to
 be contrasted with.

 io6. Some light is, indeed, thrown on the goodness
 of objects and instrumentalities by the concept of
 relative reasonableness. Thus part of the conceptual
 tie between "good" and "should be chosen" is
 captured by so-called "hypothetical imperatives, "i.e.
 statements of the form we have been considering.
 Clearly there is an intuitive connection between
 "juicy apples are good" and "if a person wants
 enjoyable apples, they should choose juicy ones."
 107. Yet, after all, we distinguish "goods" from
 "necessities (relative to a purpose)." Thus, strictly
 speaking, the core of
 If Jones want S, he ought to do A
 is
 If Jones wants X he must do A
 for that is the proper force of the implication on
 which it is grounded, which tells us that Jones doing
 A is a necessary condition of Jones getting X.
 108. And the same is true of
 If Jones wants an X which is (p, he should choose
 one which is \|/.
 The "must" can be weakened by a ceteris paribus clause
 to allow for optional alternatives, but this root idea
 remains that of a necessary condition.
 109. And, after all, there is an air of paradox about
 If Jones wants to shoot people quietly, he should
 (ought to) use a silencer.
 We would feel more comfortable with
 If Jones wants to shoot people quietly, he must
 (would have to) use a silencer.
 11 o. Reflection on this fact suggests that when
 either "ought" or "should" is used in the phrasing, the
 implication is that the "want" clause refers to a
 purpose which is in some way connected to an intrinsic
 good.
 in. Thus we are willing to say that
 If Jones wants to be healthy he should (ought to)
 eat a balanced diet
 where we think of eating a balanced diet as a good by
 virtue of its relation to health. More, however, seems
 to be involved than that the intention to eat a
 balanced diet is reasonable relative to the intention to
 be healthy, for the goodness of eating a balanced diet
 seems to be grounded in the goodness of health. Is
 health, in turn a good by virtue of its relation to
 something else? Is not our search for a non-relative
 reasonableness equivalent to a search for an intrinsic
 good?
 112. And, indeed, we do think of instrumentalities
 as good because we think of the intention to have them
 available as reasonable relative to an intrinsically good
 purpose. But what might such a purpose be?
 113. And is the intrinsic goodness of a purpose (i.e.
 a purposed?intended?state of affairs) a matter of a non
 relative reasonableness of the purposing?intending?
 X
 114. Consider the intention expressed by
 Would that I lived a satisfying life all things
 considered.
 It has long been argued20 that what pattern of life
 would satisfy a given person is a question of fact?
 difficult to be sure, but in principle capable of being
 given an objective or, in a non-pejorative sense,
 scientific answer.
 115. It has also been argued, for an equally long
 time, that of necessity a person does seek his own
 happiness. The oddness of the intention
 Would that I did not lead a satisfying life, all things
 considered
 has been construed as a matter of a psychological
 impossibility of having this intention.
 116. Indeed there has been a tendency to think
 that as a matter of psychological necessity, all
 deliberate or reflective (as contrasted with impulsive)
 action is grounded in an intention of which
 Would that I led a satisfying life, all things

 considered, which means p and not-q and . . .
 and that I do A and that I do not do B] ?
 (?) Shall be [I do B which means that I not do A
 and q and not-p and . . . and that I not lead a
 satisfying life all things considered]
 of which only the former can, as a matter of
 psychological necessity, be accepted.
 117. Of the mistakes which spoil the insight
 contained in this tradition, the most obvious is that
 which posits that the intention
 Shall be [I lead a satisfying life, all things
 considered]
 is a constituent in all rationally elaborated alternatives
 (i.e. in all non-impulsive action).
 118. Notice that the phrase "satisfying life all
 things considered" represents what the scholastics
 called a. formal end. As such it has only such force in
 particular practical reasonings as a "namely rider"
 would provide. Thus the text of the above intention
 with respect to a particular occasion should read,
 schematically,
 Shall be [I lead a satisfying life, all things?
 namely:/?, q,r,...?considered].
 119. Yet there is a more basic mistake, as is shown
 by the appeal to psychological necessity. The reader
 will remember my caveat, in paragraph 69 above,
 against supposing that the difference between intend?
 ing and believing is "merely psychological." A related
 point needs to be made here.
 120. Is the oddness of accepting alternative (?)
 above a "mere" matter of psychological impossibility?
 Is one simply appealing to the principle "ought
 implies can" in the form "what can't be, can't be
 reasonable" to conclude that alternative (?) can't be
 reasonable? After all, it might be said, an intention
 can't be reasonable unless it can be had !
 121. But, of course, it wouldn't follow from the
 non-reasonableness of (?) that (a) was reasonable.
 122. And, indeed, in what sense could (a) be a
 reasonable intention? Perhaps because of the phrase
 "all things considered." For we have seen that the
 principle of taking all relevant facts and purposes
 into consideration is built into the logic of practical
 reasoning.
 123. Thus it would seem that intentions which are
 arrived at by taking all relevant considerations into
 account are, in so far forth, reasonable.21
 124. If, however, the formal intention
 Shall [I promote my own happiness, all things
 considered]
 were intrinsically reasonable, then the intentions which
 are implied by it would also be reasonable, period. This
 is to say, they would not merely be reasonable on the
 hypothesis that something else is reasonable, but
 reasonable because that something else is reasonable. We
 must distinguish between categorical reasonableness (of
 which intrinsic reasonableness is the prime mover)
 and relative (or hypothetical) reasonableness. Reasona?
 bleness (like theoremhood) can be simultaneously
 categorical and derivative.
 125. And if all this is correct, then the idea that the
 intention that one lead a satisfying life is a psycholog?
 ically necessary intention can be traced to a miscon
 strual of the connection, pointed out in the opening
 paragraphs of this essay, between "seeing" implica?
 tions and having ceteris paribus propensities to exhibit
 uniformities in one's modes of thought.
 126. Thus it is not psychologically impossible to
 opt for alternative (?). All we need say is that the
 "pressure of reason" is against it. And the source of
 this pressure lies not in theformal end "satisfying life all
 things considered," but in the conceptual pressure to
 include in the elaboration of this intention on this
 occasion all relevant specific considerations, i.e. to
 enrich the "namely" rider.
 127. The "specific" considerations deemed rele?
 vant on any particular occasion will inevitably be, to
 a greater or lesser extent, fragmentary and generic.
 But this humanly unavoidable fact would be a flaw
 only in the practical reasoning of an angel.
 XI
 128. That it is not psychologically impossible to
 fly in the face of intentions having the formal
 structure "would that I led a satisfying life all things
 considered," is important, not only because it is true,
 but because it opens the door for a class of intentions
 which have logical features not yet considered, and
 which provide the framework for an understanding
 of the moral point of view.
 129. And, indeed, if one places the conceptual
 considerations advanced in the preceding section in
 the context of classical moral philosophy, it is

 21 I leave to other occasions the problem of mobilizing such distinctions as those between known relevant considerations, available
 relevant considerations, potentially available relevant considerations, and between objective reasonableness, subjective reasonableness, etc.
 The point is to get reasonableness into the picture.

 ON REASONING ABOUT VALUES 95
 Egoism according to which the fundamental intrinsic
 value is one's own happiness, all things considered.
 130. Rational Egoism, of course?except in its
 most extreme form?acknowledges the existence of
 sympathy and benevolence, and even grants that
 sympathetic and benevolent purposes can be wide in
 scope and intense in feeling. Yet it denies that they
 can generate a mode of reasonableness which is other
 than the relative reasonableness of such hypothetical
 imperatives as
 If one wants to help widows and orphans, one
 should, for example, support laws against fraud
 and embezzlement.
 Intrinsic reasonableness, the Egoist argues, requires
 an over-arching purpose which can find a place for
 both self-oriented and other-oriented "particular"
 purposes?and this, it is argued, can only be provided
 by the pursuit of one's own happiness, all things
 considered.
 131. Yet we saw that the "can" is suspect. Is it a
 matter of psychological possibility ? That is, is Self
 Love the only over-arching purpose one can have? Or
 is Self Love the only over-arching purpose that can
 generate an intrinsic reasonableness? One suspects
 that by granting the existence of "particular"
 sympathetic and benevolent intentions, the Egoist has
 weakened the traditional argument from the supposed
 psychological impossibility of "cool hour" altruism.
 What, then, about reasonableness?
 132. That informed self-interest and the moral
 point of view do, on occasion, conflict is a fact which
 is built into the human situation. To understand the
 nature and possibility of this conflict, we must take
 into account a further dimension of practical reasona?
 bleness?one which, indeed, is closely tied to the very
 nature of reasonableness itself.
 133. The challenge we face is, in essence, the
 following: Can we preserve the general strategy of
 the argument to date, and yet take distinctively moral
 values into account? I think so, and I will begin to
 sketch a line of thought which, I believe, adds the
 necessary dimension to the logic of purposes and
 intentions.
 134. Consider the wish,
 Would that I were happy.
 This wish is obviously I-centered. How exactly is this
 I-centeredness to be understood? What feature of the
 expression of the wish embodies it ?
 135. To begin with, there is the obvious fact that
 the subject matter of the wish is formulated by means
 of the context dependent referring expression "I."
 The belief expressed by
 I am in Houston
 is in the same way I-centered.
 136. If Jones also says
 I am in Houston
 there is a sense in which he is saying the "same thing"
 I did and a sense in which he is saying something
 different. As Strawson would put it, he is using the
 same sentence to make a different statement. To this
 we could add that he is ascribing the same property,
 being now in Houston, to himself that I ascribed to myself.
 137. Let us put this by saying that the wish and the
 belief are referentially I-centered.
 138. Thus, if King Jones thinks
 Shall be [I possess Paris]
 and King Smith thinks
 Shall be [I possess Paris]
 they have, in a sense, the same intention, and, in a
 sense, different intentions. This fact makes possible a
 familiar witticism. Each can truthfully say: that
 which he wants, / want also.
 139. From this perspective, the intention expressed
 by
 Shall be [the nations remain at peace]
 would not be referentially I-centered.22 Yet if the
 argument of the early sections of this essay is correct,
 there is a way in which this expression of intention is
 covertly subject matter I-centered. For we found it to
 be a conceptual truth that, given that its being the
 cas ? that-/> implies my doing A,
 It shall be the case that-p
 implies, ceteris paribus,
 I shall do A.
 140. In other words, even though the manifest
 content of '/>' is not referentially I-centered, expres?
 sions of intention of the form
 22 Of course the expression is implicitly I-centered in that it directly or indirectly involves the use of indicator words ("indexicals"). But
 tokens of spatial indexicals (e.g. "here") and temporal indexicals (e.g. "now") can have the same reference when used by different
 persons, whereas, truistically, "I" cannot. And the important way in which expressions of intention can be covertly I-centered, is tied to this
 latter fact.

 Shall be [p]
 have, by virtue of the conceptual grammar of "shall,"
 a conceptual tie to expressions of intention of the
 form
 Shall [I do A]
 which latter is referentially I-centered.
 141. After all, it is a conceptual point about the
 universe of intentions that its point dyappui lies in
 intentions to do and, in the last analysis in the I-here
 now intentions to do which are volitions, and,
 paralysis aside, culminate in action.
 142. We might put this by saying that all intentions
 are explicitly or implicitly action I-referential.
 143. To put it in this way, however, obscures the
 fact that although "in the last analysis" all action is
 action by individuals, and although all volition has
 "in the last analysis" the form
 Shall [I do A here and now]
 there is an important sense in which even such
 intentions can transcend I-centeredness.
 144. The key point lies in the fact that one can
 think of oneself as a member of a group. This obvious
 truth is tied to certain features of the conceptual
 grammar of reference to groups.
 145. I can refer to myself either verbally or in foro
 interno as Wilfrid Sellars, as the author of "Empiricism
 and the Philosophy of Mind," or as /.
 146. Similarly I can refer to a group as the Society
 for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, as the
 organization which won the Pittsburgh Civic Medal
 last year, or I can refer to it as we. Which group is, on
 any occasion, referred to as we can be made explicit
 by a modifier, thus we Texans, we members of the
 American Philosophical Association, etc.
 147. But before we can put these familiar points to
 good use, they must first be elaborated. We must take
 into account certain other features of the logical
 grammar of "we."
 148. In the first place, there is the obvious fact that
 we includes /.
 149. Then there is the related fact that actions can
 be ascribed to individuals not only where they are
 picked out by singular terms, e.g.
 Socrates ran. The president ran
 but also where they are referred to by using the
 apparatus of quantification, thus
 Everybody ran
 or, more interestingly,
 Each of us ran.
 150. Consider, therefore, the intention
 Shall be [each of us will run a hard race].
 Notice, in the first place, that this intention is
 intersubjective (with respect to us) in the sense that any
 of us can have this intention, where, qua state of affairs
 intended it is, in a stong sense, the same. In this respect
 it resembles
 Shall be [the nations remain at peace]
 151. But it has already been suggested that the
 latter is action I-centered. Thus, consider the dialogue
 Jones : Shall be [the nations remain at peace]
 Smith: Shall be [the nations remain at peace].
 Although Jones and Smith are expressing a shareable
 state of affairs intention, the former, as expressed by
 Jones, implies, given certain relevant considerations,
 Shall [I, Jones, do A]
 and the latter
 Shall [I, Smith, do B]P
 152. We can put this by saying that a shareable
 state of affairs intention (where this amounts to more
 than a shareable wish) implies, for each person by
 whom it can be shared, referentially I-centered action
 intentions.
 153. Consider, next
 (a) Shall be [each of us have a new car].
 This subject-matter shareable (among us) intention
 obvously implies every intention the expression of
 which results from replacing "each of us" by a
 designation of a member of us, e.g. Tom, thus
 (?) Shall be [Tom have a new car].
 Thus, each person who has shareable intention (a has
 an intention which implies intention (?), which is
 also a subject-matter shareable intention.
 154. On the other hand, each person (e.g. Dick)
 who has intention (a) has an intention which implies
 for him an intention of the form, (y)
 (y) Shall be [I, Dick, have a new car]
 23 Remember that what is implied by Jones's (or Smith's) intention is implied by that intention whether or not Jones (or Smith) comes
 to have the implied intention.

 ON REASONING ABOUT VALUES 97
 which, of course, is not a subject matter shareable
 intention.
 155. We might be tempted to call it a referentially
 I-centered intention ; and, indeed, to do so would be
 in accordance with our usage up to now. Yet if we
 consider it in relation to (a) which implies it, the
 phrase "I-centered" strikes us as inappropriate. For
 in practical contexts, the phrase "ego-centered" has an
 implication with respect to motivation which is
 inconsistent with the idea that Dick has reasoned
 Shall be [each of us have a new car]
 So, Shall be [/, Dick, will have a new car].
 156. In his reasoning, so to speak, Dick has come
 into the picture as "one of us." We might, therefore,
 reformulate his intention as
 Shall be [I, Dick, because I am one of us, have a new
 car].
 Notice that here we are taking into account features
 of the content of intentions from which we have
 hitherto made abstraction. (See paragraphs 77-8.) It
 is important to realize that because is just as much a
 part of the content of the above intention as it is a part
 of the belief content expressed by
 The Pirates should win because they are the better
 team
 and has the same rationale.
 157. Notice, next, that although (a) is a state-of
 qffairs shareable intention, it does not seem to be an
 action shareable intention, for as far as anything we
 have brought into the picture so far is concerned, its
 connection with action is via the fact that as a state of
 affairs intention it implies for each person who can
 share it, e.g. Dick, given that Dick's promoting the
 state of affairs each member of the group having a new car
 implies Dick's doing A, e.g. contributing to a fund,
 (?) Shall [I, Dick, contribute to the car fund]24
 158. We can put this by saying that an intention
 can be we-referential qua state of affairs intention, and
 yet be action I-centered.
 159. This would be a special case of the idea that
 an intention can be shareable in its manifest content,
 thus
 Shall be [the nations remain at peace],
 and yet be action I-centered in the sense that all its
 implications with respect to intentions to do are of the
 form
 Shall [I, S, do A]
 XII
 160. We have seen (paragraph 141-2 above) that
 in a sense all intentions are explicitly or implicitly
 action I-referential. We are now in a position to ask
 the framework question : Is there any way in which
 an intention can be not only ?^-referential, but action
 we-referential ?
 161. To answer this question, we must retrace our
 steps and remember that way back before the concept
 of ?w-intentions was introduced, it was noted that a
 person can envisage one of their actions sub specie So
 be-it, as when, for example, I represent myself as
 handing over money to a highwayman, thus
 Shall be [. .. and I will hand over the money]
 So-be-it
 which contrasts with the sub specie "up-to-me"
 intention
 Shall [I keep my cool].
 162. A scenario which contains the latter is explicitly
 action I-referential, for it contains my doing A as an
 intention to do rather than as (via So-be-it) a factual
 constituent of an intention.
 163. Thus consider the difference between
 Shall be [.. . and most of us will not resist
 temptation] So-be-it
 and
 Shall [each of us resist temptation].
 In the former, the action of resisting temptation
 enters into the intention as a constituent of a belief
 rather than as something intended.
 164. Whereas in the latter, resisting comes in as
 something to be done. Thus the latter is surely the we
 intention counterpart of the explicitly I-referential
 action intention
 Shall [I keep my cool].
 165. Schematically, the difference is that between
 Shall be [... and each of us will do A, if in C]
 So-be-it
 24 Given the facts of the matter, of course, it might imply that Harry instead of contributing to the fund, butters up his friend the automobile
 dealer.

 and
 Shall [each of us do A, if in C].
 166. The following is a perfectly coherent
 intention
 Shall be [each of us do A and most of us will not do A]P
 167. It is essential to note the the intention
 Shall [any of us do A, if in C]
 must not be confused with the intention
 Shall [everyone of us do A, if in C].
 The latter is an intention which is realized only if
 everyone of us who is in C does A. The former is
 realized even if only a single one of us who is in Cdoes
 A.26
 168. It must also be carefully borne in mind that
 although the concept of a group intention and a
 group action is a perfectly legitimate one, the action
 we-referential intentions we are considering are
 intentions had by individuals. It is individuals who intend
 Shall [each of us do A, if in C].
 169. We have seen that the intendible constituents
 of an intention (as contrasted with the So-be-it
 constituents) are there sub specie "up to me." One
 might therefore be tempted to expostulate: "What
 others do is not up to me. How, then, can 'Shall [each
 of us do A]9 express a proper intention, since 'each'
 refers to others than oneself?"
 170. A superficial answer would point out that on
 occasion what another does is, at least to some extent
 up to me. That we can influence people is as relevant
 to practical reasoning as that we can influence sticks
 and stones.
 171. The answer which meets the question, how?
 ever, involves the fact (noted in paragraph 81) that
 to say that the intendible consituents of an intention
 are those which are present sub specie "up to me" is
 equivalent to accompanying them with the condi?
 tional "if it is up to me," thus
 Shall be [if it is up to me, I do 4].
 172. Now "up to me" is the first person form of
 "up to X." Obviously other referring expressions can
 replace "X." Thus the correct answer to the above
 challenge consists in calling attention to the fact that
 the "up to the agent"ness of action we-referential
 intention is to be formulated as follows,
 Shall [each of us, if it is up to them, do A]
 and this in no way requires that what others do be up
 to me.
 173. Notice, finally, that the circumstances in
 which each person is to act may include (via So-be-it)
 a reference to what it is believed that others will in
 point of fact do, thus
 Shall [each of us pick up the torch, if the one of us
 to the right of them drops it]
 taken together with "My neighbor to the right has
 dropped the torch" implies, via Shall-be and So-be-it,
 Shall be [each of us pick up the torch if the one of
 us to the right of them drops it and my neighbor to
 the right has dropped it]
 and hence, via the instantiation move from "each of
 us" to "I," Modus Ponens and Shall-be,
 Shall [I pick up the torch].
 XIII
 174. We are almost through with the necessary
 hair-splitting. As a matter of fact all that remains to
 be done is to combine the above distinctions with
 those which were drawn in the first part of this essay
 and apply them to some intuitively relevant cases.
 175. Thus, consider the intention
 Shall be [whooping cranes survive].
 This is a shareable intention available for members of
 the Whooping Crane Society, as is
 Shall be [each of us WCS members do what he can,
 ceteris paribus, to promote the survival of whooping
 cranes].
 176. And consider the general hypothetical
 imperative,
 25 The reader should reflect on the intention
 Shall [each of us not take the short cut this week unless more than ten of us will take it]
 See my comment on the "generalization argument" in Science and Metaphysics, Chap. VIII, sec. xiii.
 26 Thus, for
 Shall [any of us do A, if in C\
 to be a proper intendible, it need not be practically possible that everybody does A, if in C.

 ON REASONING ABOUT VALUES 99
 If a member of the WCS wants to promote the
 survival of the whooping crane, he should pay his
 dues and obey the by-laws.
 This tells us that
 "Shall [each of us members of the WCS pay his
 dues and obey the by-laws]"
 is reasonable relative to
 "Shall [each of us members of the WCS promote
 the survival of whooping cranes]."
 177. We have an implication which relates one
 we-referential action intention to another.
 178. We-referential action intentions imply inten?
 tions to act on the part of individuals, not simply by
 virtue of the general principle which relates "Shall
 be" to "Shall I do," but directly by virtue of the relation
 between "Shall anybody do" and "Shall Ido."
 179. If the reasonableness of an available intention
 of the form
 Shall [I do A]
 is a matter of its reasonableness relative to (i.e. its
 being implied by) an intention of the form
 Shall [any of us do ...]
 this might be indicated by flagging the "shall" of the
 former intention with a subscript "we," thus
 Shallwe[Idoi4].
 Thus understood, the later is equivalent to the schema
 Shall [I do A, because shall any of us do . . .]
 At this point paragraph 156 should be reviewed.
 180. Correspondingly, if a person has the intention
 Shall [I do A]
 and has it because it is implied by the intentions
 Shall [any of us do A]
 which he also has, we can say that Jones intends to do
 A sub specie "one of us," and flag our representation of
 his intention with a subscript "we," thus,
 Jones intends "Shallwe [I do A]"
 181. If I have the intention
 Shall be [whooping cranes survive]
 I may infer, first
 Shall be [the Whooping Crane Society survive]
 and, then, by virtue of the connection between state
 of affairs intentions and intentions to do (together
 with relevant considerations)
 Shall [I pay my dues].
 In this case, my intention, though it concerns the WCS,
 of which I am a member, is not from the point of view
 of a member of the WCS.27
 182. Thus which of the implication structures I
 'pick up' in my deliberations about paying my dues
 determines whether the point of view from which I
 am reasoning is "private" or that of a member of the
 group.
 183. Notice finally, that a shareable state-of-affairs
 intention will, in general, have implications with
 respect to intentions to do of both the I-referential
 and the we-referential kind. (Since the latter, in turn,
 imply I-referential action intention, we might distin?
 guish we-derivative from primary I-referential action
 intentions.) The facts by virtue of which these
 implications obtain may well overlap, though they
 cannot coincide.
 XIV
 184. But the facts that we-referential intentions
 can be shared and that an action intention can be we
 referential are logical points which establish at best a
 necessary condition for the possibility of a distinctively
 moral point of view. What can be added to turn this
 necessary condition into a sufficient condition ?
 185. The dialectics of our elaboration of Rational
 Egoism suggests that what we are looking for is a non
 relative reasonableness pertaining to we-referential
 action intentions. Is there such a thing?
 186. That there is, is suggested by the fact that the
 purpose or intention expressed by
 Shall [each of us WCS members promote the
 survival of whooping cranes]
 is reasonable Tor members of the WCS, because it is by
 virtue of that shareable intention that there is such a
 thing as the WCS.
 187. This intention defines what might be called
 "the WCS member's point of view." It is the prime
 27 Notice that the WCS can be said to have a point of view as an organization, just as it can be said to act as an organization. The concept
 of groups purposes, intentions and actions is an important and highly relevant one which, however, I am skirting on the present occasion.

 mover intention of this point of view,28 and generates,
 given matters of factual implications and premises,
 subordinate intentions, the relative reasonableness of
 which is grounded in its intrinsic and non-relative
 reasonableness as constituting the WCS point of view.
 188. Of course, any member of the WCS can, and
 indeed often will, work out in his practical reasoning
 not only the implications of the WCS point of view
 for people who are in their particular circumstances,
 but also the implications of these circumstances for
 the personal point of view, or, in more traditional
 terminology, that of Self Love, i.e.
 Shall [I promote my happiness].
 189. Is there, then, an intention which defines the
 moral point of view? Is there an intrinsically
 reasonable we-referential action intention which
 stands to a moral community as the intention that
 "we" promote the survival of whooping cranes stands
 to members of the Whooping Crane Society ?
 190. Notice that while the intention that we
 members of the WCS promote the survival of
 whooping cranes is intrinsically reasonable for
 members of the WCS, the bare intention that
 whooping cranes survive, if reasonable, does not have
 this same kind of reasonableness. The point becomes
 obvious if we change the example to that of the
 Society for the Preservation of Architectural
 Landmarks.
 191. In discussing Rational Egoism I distinguished
 between the formal intention
 Shall [I do that which promotes my happiness, all
 relevant things considered]
 and the specific contentual intentions which, in partic?
 ular circumstances, "spell out" this "regulative
 principle" with namely riders.
 192. I pointed out, in paragraph 124 above, that
 if the above formal intention is intrinsically reasonable,
 then the intentions which are implied by it are also
 reasonable, period. That is to say, they are not merely
 reasonable on the hypothesis that something else is
 reasonable, but reasonable because that something else is
 reasonable. Thus we distinguish between categorical
 reasonableness (of which intrinsic reasonableness is the
 prime mover) and relative (or hypothetical) reasonable?
 ness. Reasonableness, we saw, can be both categorical
 and derivative.
 193- Our question thus becomes, Is there an
 intrinsically (and hence categorically) reasonable
 formal intention which is the regulative principle of
 the moral point of view?
 194. Analogy would suggest the following :
 Shall [each of us do that which, in the circumstances,
 promotes the happiness of each and every one of us,
 all relevant things considered].
 195. . . . Considering has as its state of affairs
 intention core
 Shall be [each and every one of us leads a satisfying
 life, all relevant things considered]
 which is the formal specification of an intrinsic and
 encompassing good.
 196. Shareable by whom? Who are we? Though
 these questions are, in a sense, the same, let me begin
 with the second. Who are we? Not, it should be clear,
 the members of a corporate group, a group having
 corporate intentions and doing corporate deeds. The
 conceptual framework with which we are concerned
 is presupposed rather than constituted by "shoulds" and
 "oughts" which pertain to groups considered
 collectively.
 197. This calls attention to the fact that a key
 feature of the above formal intention is the absence of
 an explicit membership rider for the "us"?as con?
 trasted with the "us members of the WCS" of the
 shareable intention we have just been exploring, and
 the "us Texans" mentioned earler.
 198. Is there, perhaps, an "implicit" and indeter?
 minate membership rider, one which is left to be
 specified by the context on particular occasions?
 199. Notice that what a person who is deliberating
 in the framework of this formal intention thinks their
 circumstances are is (obviously) not specified by the
 intention. The reasonableness on particular occasions of
 thinking that the circumstances are such and such is
 not to be equated with their being in fact thought to
 be such and such.
 200. Can we similarly distinguish between what a
 person who is deliberating in the framework of this
 formal intention thinks of as us, and what it is reasonable
 for the deliberator to think of as us, all relevant things
 considered?
 201. Of course, the formal intention does not
 specify what all these relevant things are, any more
 28 Notice that there is a sense in which this intention can be construed as grounded in the intention
 Would that whooping cranes survive!
 which is a shareable intention, one, however, which abstracts from the distinction between we-referential and non-we-referential action
 intentions.

 ON REASONING ABOUT VALUES IOI
 than the principle of Self Love tells one in particular
 circumstances the actual cash value of promoting
 one's happiness on the whole, all relevant things
 considered, in just these circumstances.
 202. Thus, the absence of an explicit membership
 rider for the "us" does not mean that there is an
 "implicit" namely rider which is filled, in any given
 context, by a reference to whatever group a deliber?
 ator happens to "identify with" or think of as us (e.g.
 weWASPs).
 203. The mere fact that a person identifies with
 WASPS no more entails that it is reasonable for him to
 identify with WASPs, than the fact that one believes
 oneself to be on terra firma entails that it is reasonable for
 one to believe this.
 204. It is in the logical pressures generated by the
 principles which govern practical reasoning, and
 which find their expression in "all relevant things
 considered" that we find the point of the distinction
 between the moral community and those with whom
 we identify.
 205. It will be remembered that I asked not only
 "who are we?" but "shareable by whom?" Do the
 above considerations throw any light on the latter
 question?
 206. Surely once we have distinguished between
 the moral community and those with whom one who
 deliberates in the moral point of view happens to
 identify, we cannot stop short of identifying the moral
 community with that group with which it is reason?
 able for us, all relevant things considered, to identify.
 And, in the context of the formal intention
 Shall [each of us do that which in the circumstances
 promotes the well-being of each and every one of
 us, all relevant things considered].
 Who can that be, but rational beings generally ?
 207. Notice that I am not saying that everybody
 shares this shareable intention. I am simply saying
 that it defines the moral point of view, as contrasted
 with, say the WASP point of view. The intention
 Shall [each of us WASPs do that which, in the
 circumstances promotes our common good, all
 relevant things considered]
 is a shareable (by WASPs) we-referential action
 intention which is logically respectable. It simply does
 not constitute the moral point of view.
 208. The question is it egoistically reasonable to
 acquire or maintain a propensity to intend sub specie
 "one of us" is a perfectly meaningful one. (Why
 should I be moral?) The fact that it is so in no way
 brings into jeopardy the autonomy of the moral point
 of view.
 209. Finally the reader should bear in mind that
 this essay has been concerned with what a Kantian
 would call the formal structure of the moral point of
 view. In other words, I have been concerned with
 such issues as the intersubjectivity, universalizability,
 and reasonableness of categorical imperatives. For an
 exploration of how a utilitarian content fits into
 this Kantian form, the reader should consult the con?
 cluding sections (pp. 218-29) of Science and
 Metaphysics.29
 Note : This paper was initially presented as the first
 of three Tsanoff lectures at Rice University in
 September of 1978. It was expanded and revised in
 response to conceptual pressures from Kurt Baier,
 Gerald Massey, and Don Morrison. I am grateful for
 the care with which they read and commented on the
 text. As a result a number of mistakes have been
 corrected and some topics brought to a sharper focus.
 That the main line of argument remains essentially
 unchanged may, of course, be due to pig-headedness.
