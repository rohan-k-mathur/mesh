Ludics: Argumentation, Inference, and Designs

This response provides a rigorous, detailed, and thorough analysis of the abstract, introduction, and foundational concepts concerning Ludics, actions, and designs as presented in the provided sources, specifically drawing from the text titled "Argumentation and Inference: A Unified Approach".
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Argumentation and Inference: A Unified Approach – Abstract, Introduction, and Foundational Concepts
The source presents a foundational exploration into integrating argumentative dialogue analysis and inference mechanisms within a unified theoretical framework derived from logic and game theory. The central thesis posits Ludics, a specific development in logic, as the appropriate formal tool for this integration, departing critically from traditional nonmonotonic approaches.
Analysis of the Abstract (Source Text Excerpt)
The abstract introduces Ludics as a framework uniquely positioned to unify the analysis of dialogues and reasoning systems. Ludics is not merely a logical theory; its construction intrinsically incorporates concepts drawn from game theory.
The core theoretical objects introduced are designs, which are defined as an abstraction and generalization of the concept of a proof. Crucially, the sources assert that the fundamental operation within this system—the interaction between designs—is equivalent to key meta-level operations in logical theories, namely cut elimination or modus ponens. This mechanism is leveraged as a natural means for representing the dynamic processes of dialogue and inference.
In modeling dialogue, a design is conceived as a set of sequences of alternate actions, conceptually analogous to a move in game theory. This allows for a specific interpretation of speech acts within argumentative dialogues as dialogue acts. A dialogue act is formally specified by coupling a Ludics action with the specific linguistic expression that reveals this action in a turn of speech.
Furthermore, the framework addresses the computational aspect of reasoning by proposing that arguments generated during an intervention are stored in a commitment state. This commitment state, defined as a set of designs associated with a given locutor, is utilized for logical computation. The management and evolution of this state depend on the intricate interaction between its constituent designs and the locutor's primary design representing their viewpoint on the dialogue.
The utility of this proposed framework is exemplified by revisiting and analyzing a juridical dialogue previously examined by Prakken, suggesting its capacity to provide an alternative perspective on established problems in computational law and argumentation.
Analysis of the Introduction (Section 1)
The introduction meticulously establishes the necessity for integrating robust analytical tools in the study of argumentative dialogues, a domain that requires both linguistic structural analysis and mechanisms for handling arguments and knowledge from multiple participants.
Historically, the dominant formalisms applied to this field have been game theory and nonmonotonic logics.
1. Game Theory: Recognized as a natural setting for capturing the alternating structure inherent in dialogue. A dialogue is analogous to a play, and arguments function as moves. The objective for a locutor is to achieve a victory state where their last argument cannot be refuted by the interlocutor. Each turn of speech introduces elements necessary for subsequent actions.
2. Nonmonotonic Logics (NML): These logics are employed to achieve objectives critical for rational discourse management: checking counter-arguments (facts or propositions) against the locutor's knowledge, and evaluating and comparing arguments to determine the optimal next move. The primary justification for recourse to NML, as noted by the authors and acknowledged in the general literature (e.g., Prakken (2005) cited in the source), stems from the rational management of problematic propositions: those that may be contradicted, possess fallacious premises, or whose validity is fundamentally questioned during the exchange.
The novelty introduced by the authors' approach using Ludics is its claim to integrate the game theoretical structure with an inferential system, offering a pathway for managing contradictions without adopting the nonmonotonic framework generally favored in the domain.
Analysis of Foundational Concepts (Section 2.1)
The conceptual framework is grounded in Ludics, an approach that integrates game theoretical structure with an inferential system, treating the interaction of designs as a form of modus ponens or traversal through arguments. Notably, the adoption of Ludics, derived from Linear Logic, is justified by the theoretical capacity of Linear Logic to model the dynamic processes of erasing and adding information within a fundamentally monotonic logical structure, thereby obviating the need for non-monotonic systems in modeling argumentation.
The primitive unit of interaction in Ludics is the action.
Actions and the Justification Relation
Actions possess intrinsic characteristics that govern their role in interaction:
1. Polarity: Actions are polarized, existing as dual pairs (κ and κ) such that κ=κ.
2. Justification: A justification relation is established between actions, which is an explicit reflection of game theoretical concepts.
Chronicles and Designs
Actions are organized into alternate sequences termed chronicles in Ludics. To constitute a valid chronicle, these sequences must satisfy specific structural conditions:
• A positive action must either be initial or be justified by a negative action that precedes it within the sequence.
• A negative action, with the exception of the very first one in the sequence, must be justified by the positive action that immediately precedes it.
Following the game metaphor, these alternating action sequences are conceptualized as plays, which collectively constitute larger organizing structures, analogous to strategies. In the formal language of Ludics, these structures are precisely the designs. This sets the stage for modeling the entirety of an argumentative dialogue as the interaction between two designs, one corresponding to each locutor.

Actions, the Justification Relation and Designs
In Ludics, primitive elements of interaction are actions. Actions are
polarized and appear as dual pairs: for each positive action (resp. neg-
ative) κ, there exists a dual negative action (resp. positive) κ and
κ = κ. As in game theory, a justification relation between actions is
given. Moreover, actions are organized in alternate sequences called
chronicles in Ludics. These sequences should satisfy the following
conditions: (i) a positive action can be either initial or justified by a
negative action that precedes it in the sequence, (ii) a negative action,
except the first, is justified by the positive action immediately preced-
ing. Following the metaphor of games, these alternate sequences of
actions can be seen as plays that can be grouped to form strategies
called designs in Ludics (Basaldella & Faggian 2009). Thus, designs
are sets of chronicles that may be interwoven to give rise to what tran-
spires during an interaction. Not all sets of chronicles can be designs:
in particular a design should be organized as a forest, with only one
root when the initial action is positive.
Example 2. We consider only the first nine interventions of example 1. As
a rough approximation, each turn of speech is associated with one action:
κ1, . . . , κ9.

The sequence of actions κ1, . . . , κ9 is a play in
terms of game semantics. The justification re-
lation between the actions κ1, . . . , κ9 is given
on the right where an arrow from action κ to
action κ′ denotes that κ is justified by κ′
.
- The first action κ1 is initial: with interven-
tion I 1, the examiner initiates the dialogue.
- Actions κ2 and κ8 are justified by this first
action κ1: the dialogue begins about music
(intervention I 2) then the discussion turns on
math (intervention I 8).
- Intervention I 4 (action κ4) also introduces
two elements, piano and song, that are foci of
interventions I 5 and I 7 (resp. actions κ5 and
κ7 ). The other actions are justified by the ac-
tions immediately preceding them.

The framework of Ludics allows for rebuilding from a play, the
shape of information that has to be minimally present in the two parts,
i.e. the two locutors in the example. The play is the trace of interaction
given by the dialogue. For that purpose, each action κi present in the
play gives rise to two dual actions, one for each reconstructed design:
a positive action noted κi and a negative action still noted κi.
The principle for rebuilding the designs is the following one:
- Let κ be a positive action present in a design, if κ′ is justified by κ
then κ′ appears as a (negative) daughter in the design. This is the case
with κ2 and κ8 with respect to κ1
.
- Let κ be a negative action present in a design, then it has only one
(positive) daughter κ′ in this design, where κ′ follows κ in the play.
Hence, for example, κ3 is the (unique) daughter of κ2.
The design on the left has two chronicles. The design on the right is
incomplete as one of its chronicles has a negative action as leaf: each
chronicle should end with a positive action. We only give here part of
the dialogue.

We rebuilt designs from the result of an interaction. In the next sub-
section, we define how designs interact when they are given a priori:
the play is then a travel through the two designs.
It is worthwile at this point to provide a few general comments on
the example. First, representing the dialogue as a trace (a sequence of
visited actions) of an interaction between two designs allows for recov-
ering the two points of view in a dialogue, one for each locutor. Each
action as it appears as an intervention in the dialogue is positive for
the locutor and negative for her addressee. More precisely, a positive
action in some locutor’s design corresponds to an active role of this lo-
cutor. A negative action in the locutor’s design corresponds to a passive
role, namely the registration of an intervention of the interlocutor. In
the previous figure, the design on the left is the point of view of the
examiner while the design on the right is the point of view of Theo
(with respect to the dialogue). Second, as we shall see more precisely
with the definition of an action in the next subsection, a positive action
gives rise to potential foci of next actions, i.e. next interventions, for
pursuing the dialogue. As such, there may be more loci induced by an
action than what is (minimally) required in the dialogue. For example,
the dialogue between Theo and the examiner may finish before inter-
vention I 8, hence speaking math (proposed by intervention I 1) may
be useless. Third, polarity of actions as stated above has nothing to

do with distinctions such as question/answer or affirmative/negative
utterances: it is only a matter of who speaks.

Ludics: Argumentation, Interaction, and Logic Retrieval

The continued rigorous report delves into the foundational mechanics of Ludics as applied to argumentation, focusing on the dynamic process of design interaction and the formal logical scaffolding retrieved from this mechanism.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 2.2: Interactions: Elementary Facts
This section introduces the core dynamic operation of the framework: the interaction between two designs, which formalizes the notion of dialogue progression through mutual consistency checking. Interaction is conceptualized as a "travel" process through the dual structures supplied by the locutors' designs.
Mechanism of Interaction
The fundamental prerequisite for interaction is that each design must contain a path corresponding to the other design, allowing a synchronized traversal. 

Interactions: Elementary Facts
An interaction occurs between two designs when each of them con-
tains a path corresponding to the other path. It involves travelling
through these two designs as follows:
- It starts with the object that contains as root a positive action (hence
unique).
- Each time it goes through a positive action κ of one of the two de-
signs, the travel continues in the other design on the negative action κ
that is dual to κ (when the negative action κ exists), then continues
on the only positive action that follows this negative action in the same
design.
This process continues as long as positive actions that are visited have
a corresponding negative action in the other design. If such a negative
action is not found, the process diverges, i.e. fails.
The trace of an interaction is given by the sequence of pairs of dual
actions followed during this interaction.

To be complete, designs in Ludics are made of two kinds of actions:

besides proper actions (as the ones used before) that may be positive
or negative, there exists a special (positive) action called the daimon
and noted †. This action may appear several times in a design, but
always as the last action of a chronicle: a daimon is used as the final
element of an interaction, or in more abstract words the final conver-
gence of the interaction. Interaction between designs may now be fully
defined: The travel begins in the design that contains the positive ver-
sion of two corresponding initial actions. Each time the travel reaches
a positive action κ of one of the two designs, the travel goes to the
negative dual action κ, if it exists, then it continues with the unique
positive action that follows κ in this design until the positive action
that is reached is the daimon. In that case, the interaction is said to
be convergent, otherwise (e.g. the negative dual action does not exist)
it is said to be divergent. In dialogues, a convergent interaction means
A dialogue that went well.

The process is highly specified by the polarity and duality of actions:
1. Initiation: The travel commences in the design whose root is a ** positive action** (which must be unique at the root).
2. Traversal Rule: Whenever the process encounters a positive action κ in one design, it shifts immediately to the dual negative action  
κ
ˉ
  in the other design, provided  
κ
ˉ
  exists within that design. From  
κ
ˉ
 , the process continues with the unique positive action that immediately follows  
κ
ˉ
  within the second design.
The process persists as long as the visited positive actions have corresponding negative duals in the counterpart design.
Convergence, Divergence, and the Daimon
A crucial distinction in this dynamic system is between success and failure, formalized as convergence and divergence:
• Divergence: If a required negative dual action is not found in the opposing design during the traversal, the process diverges, signifying a failure or inconsistency in the interaction.
• The Daimon (†): Designs are completed by incorporating a special positive action called the daimon (†), which serves as the terminal element of a chronicle. The daimon can appear multiple times, but always as the final action in a sequence.
• Convergence: An interaction is convergent if the travel process continues until the positive action reached in a design is the daimon (†). In the context of dialogues, convergence indicates a dialogue that "went well".
The resulting outcome of a convergent dialogue defines the looser as the locutor who ultimately performed the daimon action. The sequence of pairs of dual actions followed during a convergent interaction constitutes the formal trace of that interaction.
Section 2.3: How Logic is Retrieved
This section transitions the discussion from the mechanism of interaction to the formal logical properties derived from it, grounding the framework in Linear Logic.
Orthogonality and Behaviors
The core connection to logic is established through the result of interacting two designs, D and E, denoted [[D,E]]. This result is itself either divergent or still a design, excluding the dual actions encountered during the interaction.
1. Orthogonality: Two designs, D and E, are defined as orthogonal (written D⊥E) if their interaction converges and the resulting design [[D,E]] is reduced solely to the daimon (†).
2. Orthogonal Closure and Behavior: For a set of designs D, its orthogonal D 
⊥
  is the set of all designs orthogonal to every design in D. A behavior is then defined as a set of designs D that is closed under the double orthogonal operation (D=D 
⊥⊥
 ).
3. Formulas and Proofs: In this setting, a logical formula is formally represented by a behavior. A proof of a formula is interpreted as a design belonging to that behavior that specifically does not contain the daimon.
The Fax Design and Delocalization
A meta-level operation crucial for propagating information within the system is interaction with a specific design known as the fax (Fax 
ξ,ξ 
′
 
​
 ).
The interaction of a design D (with base ξ) with the fax Fax 
ξ,ξ 
′
 
​
  formally corresponds to a logical cut between a proof of a sequent ⊢A and the axiom A⊢A.
• Function: The fax primarily serves to delocalize the design it interacts with. Its function is to substitute the original base locus ξ of design D with a new locus ξ 
′
  in the resulting design, [[D,Fax 
ξ,ξ 
′
 
​
 ]], yielding a design isomorphic to D but based on ξ 
′
 .
• Loci: This mechanism reinforces the significance of loci (addresses) within Ludics, which serve as the abstract points through which interaction passes, divorced from the explicit formula structure. Loci are defined as sequences of integers, structured such that locus L.i is justified by locus L.
Dialogue Acts: Definition and Components (Definition 1)
Building directly upon the concepts of actions, duality, and loci, the foundation of dialogue modeling is formalized through the definition of a dialogue act (κ), which links the logical actions of Ludics to linguistic expression.
A dialogue act is either a proper dialogue act or the daimon (†).
Proper Dialogue Act Components:
A proper dialogue act is a tuple (ε,L,I,e), consisting of:
• Polarity (ε): Must be positive (+) or negative (−). Polarity indicates the role of the locutor: generally, the act is positive for the locutor who produces it (active role) and negative for the interlocutor who receives it (passive role or registration). An exception exists for acts representing constraints imposed by the interlocutor (e.g., presuppositions), which may be negative for the locutor producing the utterance.
• Focus (L): A finite sequence of integers designating the location of the act within the dialogical interaction. This is the address where the action is anchored.
• Ramification (I): A finite set of integers representing the potential openings created by the dialogue act, on which new dialogue acts may be produced. For example, the ramification of an action (+,L,I) suggests that continuations can be located at addresses L.i where i∈I.
    ◦ Multiplicative vs. Additive Situations: The ramification structure allows discrimination between multiplicative situations (where multiple options, like "Music or Math," remain available for parallel exploration) and additive situations (where choosing one option, like "Yes" to "Do you want to speak?", excludes the others, though distinct dialogues may stem from each mutually exclusive choice).
• Expression (e): The linguistic expression, language, or communicational fact by which the dialogue act manifests itself in the turn of speech.
The Daimon Dialogue Act
The daimon dialogue act is defined as a particular positive dialogue act (†,e), which registers the end of an interaction that concluded successfully (convergent way). The expression e in this case is often empty.
Modeling Argumentative Dialogues (Initial Elements)
The framework models dialogue between two protagonists (S and A) as a sequence of dialogue states. Each intervention is associated with an alternate sequence of dialogue acts that complements the locutor's current design.
The general principles governing the construction of the locutor's design include:
1. Both designs begin with the same initial locus.
2. The first dialogue act (positive) anchors on this locus; the addressee's corresponding initial act (negative) anchors on the same locus, modeling acceptance of the opening intervention.
3. For any intervention, the first and last dialogue acts must be positive (unless the last is the daimon) to allow the interlocutor to continue.
4. The dialogue is meaningful only if the first act of an intervention is anchored in some previously discussed element.
The design of the interlocutor is augmented by the duals of the locutor’s acts, reflecting the absorption and acceptance of the intervention. This dual sequence ensures the construction remains a valid design structure.

Ludics Modeling of Argumentation Dialogues and Dialogue Acts

Drawing upon the rigorous foundation established by Ludics in the preceding sections, the theoretical framework now transitions to the practical application of these concepts in modeling dynamic conversational processes, specifically argumentative dialogues. This analysis delves into Section 3, focusing on the motivation for modeling argumentation and the essential explication of the dialogue act.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 3: Modeling Argumentation Dialogues
The primary aim of employing Ludics is to provide a unified framework for the analysis of argumentative dialogues and their underlying reasoning mechanisms. The authors ground this objective in the acknowledgment that traditional argumentation research has fundamentally revolved around three interrelated, yet often segregated, inquiries:
1. Argumentative Schemas: Identifying the types of argumentative patterns present in dialogues.
2. Strategy and Inference: Determining how arguments facilitate reasoning, calculating optimal strategies, and identifying the next justifiable move in a controversy.
3. Contradiction Management: Establishing methods for managing contradictions that emerge during dialogue and finding a coherent resolution to the debate (an objective particularly critical in juridical contexts).
The proposed Ludics approach distinguishes itself from conventional methodologies, such as those relying on nonmonotonic logics, because it intrinsically integrates a game theoretical structure with an inferential system. This integration is key: the central dynamic operation—the interaction between designs—is conceptualized directly as a form of modus ponens or a specific traversal through arguments, linking deductive processes directly to dialogue steps.
Crucially, the inherent mechanism of Linear Logic (upon which Ludics is founded) allows for the necessary modeling of erasing and adding elements within a fundamentally monotonic logical framework. This characteristic eliminates the theoretical necessity for invoking nonmonotonic logic to handle the dynamics of knowledge updates or contradictions in argumentative exchange.
In this unified schema, the characteristics of argumentative dialogue are modeled through sequences of elementary argumentative maneuvers termed dialogue acts. Furthermore, the arguments deployed during interventions are formally retained within a commitment state for each participant, enabling subsequent formal logical computation and reasoning.
Section 3.1: Speech Acts versus Dialogue Acts
The transition from classical philosophy of language to computational models necessitates a precise, granular definition of communicative intention, leading the authors to substitute the term speech act with the more foundational dialogue act.
Conceptual and Operational Distinction
The philosophical concept of a speech act, as proposed by Searle (1969), encompasses an utterance, its conditions, and its resultant effects. However, formal analysis requires addressing supplementary factors, such as extra-linguistic elements (e.g., a gesture used for attention). The source adopts the proposal that a dialogue act is the "minimal unit of communication in a dialogical context".
A single intervention, or turn of speech, may encapsulate one or multiple dialogue acts. These acts are fundamental communicative facts whose function is to provide the dynamics and determine the shape of the dialogue. They can be explicit or implicit, verbal or non-verbal (e.g., a nod, an adverb, a prosodic feature). Operationally, a dialogue act expresses the entitlement or decision of the speaker, or the corresponding acknowledgment by the addressee.
Since a single speech act may correspond to several dialogue acts (as illustrated in Example 7), dialogue acts are regarded as significantly more elementary components.
Formal Definition of a Dialogue Act (Definition 1)
A dialogue act, κ, is formally defined as either a proper dialogue act or the specialized daimon action:
1. Proper Dialogue Act: Defined as a tuple (ε,L,I,e):
    ◦ Polarity (ε): Can be positive (+) or negative (−).
        ▪ An act is typically positive for the locutor who originates it, reflecting an active role.
        ▪ It holds a dual polarity (negative) when registered by the interlocutor, signifying a passive role (registration of the intervention).
        ▪ An important exception exists: if the act represents a constraint imposed by the interlocutor (such as a presupposition), it may be negative even for the locutor producing the utterance.
    ◦ Focus (L): A finite sequence of integers serving as the address or locus of the act, locating it within the flow of the dialogical interaction.
    ◦ Ramification (I): A finite set of integers defining the openings created by the dialogue act, specifying addresses (loci) on which new dialogue acts may subsequently be produced.
    ◦ Expression (e): The language, linguistic phrase, or communicational fact by which the dialogue act becomes manifest in the speech turn.
2. Daimon Dialogue Act: Noted (†,e). This is a particular positive dialogue act used to formally register the convergent conclusion (successful end) of an interaction. The associated expression e may often be empty.
Illustration of Dialogue Act Decomposition (Example 7)
The significance of decomposing utterances into elementary dialogue acts is vividly shown by the classic presupposition example: the judicial question, "Have you stopped beating your father?".
This single question is revealed to consist of three successive dialogue acts (κ 
1
​
 ,κ 
2
​
 ,κ 
3
​
 ), which correspond to the sequence of interventions required for logical coherence:
1. "Did you beat your father?" (κ 
1
​
 )
2. "Yes." (κ 
2
​
 )
3. "Have you stopped beating him?" (κ 
3
​
 )
If the defendant (the delinquent) proceeds with the dialogue, they implicitly confirm that the interaction does not diverge on the foundational premise. They accept justification for their next move on the negative dialogue act corresponding to κ 
3
​
 , which is anchored on the positive dialogue act κ 
2
​
 . This structure formally models the assumption that the implicit question ("Did you beat your father?") was conceded with a "Yes" answer.

Formal Dynamics of Argumentative Dialogue States

A rigorous examination of the framework transitions now from the definitional primitives (Ludics actions and dialogue acts) to the compositional and dynamic structures required for modeling discursive exchanges: the dialogue state and the specific characteristics of argumentative discourse.

Section 3.2: Dialogue Acts and Dialogue States (Inferred Title)
In the theoretical model established by the source, the argumentation process unfolds as a sequence of discrete steps, defined by the formal concept of a dialogue state, which captures the accumulated history and inferential commitments of the participants.
The Formal Dialogue State
An argumentative situation at any step i of the dialogue is formally captured by a dialogue state. This state is defined as a tuple encompassing the cognitive and structural elements specific to each locutor, S and A (the two protagonists).
Definition 3 (Argumentative Situation): A dialogue state is defined as ⟨B 
S
i
​
 ,D 
S
i
​
 ,B 
A
i
​
 ,D 
A
i
​
 ⟩.
• B 
S
i
​
  and B 
A
i
​
  are the commitment states of locutors S and A at step i.
• D 
S
i
​
  and D 
A
i
​
  are the respective designs of S and A at step i.
The initial condition (step 0, prior to the commencement of the dialogue) is marked by empty designs for both participants (D 
S
0
​
  and D 
A
0
​
  are considered empty designs).
Dynamics of Dialogue Progression
Each intervention within the dialogue enables a transition from step i to step i+1. The locutor producing the intervention is designated P 
i
 , and the other locutor is designated  
P 
i
 
 . An intervention is constituted by a sequence of dialogue acts.
The state update process is multifaceted, incorporating structural updates to the designs (capturing the sequence of interaction) and material updates to the commitment states (capturing semantic knowledge):
1. Design Augmentation (Interlocutor  
P 
i
 
 ): Except for the very first intervention, the design of the interlocutor ( 
P 
i
 
 ) is conceptually enlarged by incorporating the sequence of duals of the dialogue acts associated with P 
i
 's immediate previous intervention. This step represents  
P 
i
 
 's absorption of P 
i
 's move, indicating that  
P 
i
 
  answers without causing a formal divergence.
2. Design Augmentation (Current Locutor P 
i
 ): The design of the current locutor (P 
i
 ) is expanded by the alternate sequence of dialogue acts corresponding to their current intervention.
3. Structural Constraints on Interventions:
    ◦ The initial dialogue act of an intervention must be anchored to an element previously established in the discourse.
    ◦ To permit the interlocutor to respond, the sequence of dialogue acts constituting an intervention must begin and end with a positive dialogue act (unless the concluding act is the † daimon).
4. Commitment State Update (B 
i
 ): The commitment state of P 
i
  is revised based on the content of the current intervention. It is expanded by incorporating the Content Expressions (C.E.) that correspond to the propositions assumed by P 
i
  in the intervention (e.g., assertions, negations, or concessions). Concurrently, any C.E.s currently residing in P 
i
 's commitment state concerning propositions on which P 
i
  has now "changed her mind" are formally erased.
Section 3.3: Argumentative Dialogues
Argumentative dialogues, distinct from merely conversational ones, introduce specific formal requirements rooted in conflict resolution and the determination of acceptance status.
Peculiarities of Argumentative Dialogues
The nature of speech acts is notably constrained in argumentative settings, often limited to assertions, arguments, denials, and concessions. The defining characteristic is the introduction of the concept of "win," which is essential in a controversy where the objective is to determine "who is right". An argumentative dialogue is fundamentally distinguished by the opposition of two arguments, with each participant advancing a thesis. The core process is the exchange of arguments and counter-arguments, which continues until one thesis is formally deemed successful (winning).
The Commitment State and Logical Computation
The commitment state (B) is the repository for the arguments deployed during the dialogue, serving as the essential foundation for logical processing. It stores arguments not merely as linguistic structures but as sets of designs, referred to as Content Expressions (C.E.).
These Content Expressions are abstract designs associated with underlying logical statements or structures:
• Logical Connectives: Designs are provided to model logical operations, such as conjunction, potentially requiring dual representations for operations like strictly commutative treatments (e.g., F∧G and its negation ¬(F∧G)).
• Rules and Laws: A Content Expression can represent a complex law or rule, such as D 
r1
​
 , which is an elaborated design based on a sequent like L 
Cont−and−Del
​
 ⊢L 
to.pay
​
 . These designs contain the logical structure of the argument itself, built upon loci representing premises and conclusions (e.g., L 
Cont
​
  and L 
Del
​
 ).
• Assertions: Simple designs represent assertions, such as D 
cont
​
  for a valid contract assertion, characterized typically by a premise-less structure concluding a locus, e.g., ⊢L 
Cont
​
 .
The formal utility of the commitment state is realized through the computational procedure of interaction between these designs. By interacting designs associated with premises (e.g., D 
cont
​
 ,D 
del
​
 ) with the design associated with a rule (D 
r1
​
 ), the system performs logical computation. This interaction process is capable of yielding a formal contradiction, illustrating how the framework manages conflicts derived from the propositions and rules asserted by the participants.
The loci (addresses) attached to the argumentative elements within an intervention are critical, as they serve as delocations—abstract pointers—anchoring the new designs (Content Expressions) in the commitment state to the appropriate context derived from previous design structures.
In essence, the dialogue state formalizes the temporal evolution of belief commitment and structural coherence, making the inherent dynamism of argumentation amenable to precise logical analysis via the interaction of Ludics designs.

Ludics Framework for Argumentative Dialogue Dynamics

The theoretical formalization of argumentative dialogue transitions from defining elementary dialogue acts to constructing the overall argumentative structure and its dynamics. Section 3.4, "Towards an Argumentation Framework," outlines the methodology for representing the accumulated state of the dialogue and performing logical inference based on committed propositions.
Section 3.4: Towards an Argumentation Framework
The Ludics framework models an argumentative dialogue as a sequence of dialogue states (also referred to as argumentative situations), representing the evolving context of the exchange. This sequence is fundamentally an interaction between two designs, one representing each protagonist. In an idealized, convergent dialogue, the participant who eventually plays the daimon action (†) is deemed the looser.
Formal Definition of the Dialogue State
The argumentative situation at step i is precisely defined by the state of knowledge and the evolving structural coherence of both participating locutors, S and A.
Definition 3 (Argumentative Situation): A dialogue state is formally defined as a tuple ⟨B 
S
i
​
 ,D 
S
i
​
 ,B 
A
i
​
 ,D 
A
i
​
 ⟩:
• B 
S
i
​
  and B 
A
i
​
  represent the Commitment States (C.S.) of locutors S and A at step i, storing the material content of their arguments.
• D 
S
i
​
  and D 
A
i
​
  represent the respective designs of S and A at step i, encoding the accepted paths of interaction.
The process begins at step 0, prior to any intervention, where all designs (D) are considered empty.
Dynamics and State Evolution
Each sequential intervention produced by a locutor (P 
i
 ) advances the dialogue from state i to i+1. This transition involves concurrent updates to both the designs and the commitment states:
1. Design Update (D 
i+1
 ):
    ◦ The design of the current locutor (P 
i
 ) is expanded by incorporating the precise alternate sequence of dialogue acts associated with their current intervention.
    ◦ The design of the opposing locutor ( 
P 
i
 
 ) is augmented by incorporating the duals of the sequence of dialogue acts corresponding to P 
i
 's immediate previous intervention (excluding the very first intervention). This addition formally models the interlocutor's acceptance of the move, ensuring the dialogue continues without immediate divergence.
    ◦ The intervention must result in a design that is "compatible," meaning it remains a valid structure under Ludics' rules.
2. Commitment State Update (B 
i+1
 ):
    ◦ The commitment state of the current locutor (B 
P 
i
 
​
 ) is augmented by incorporating the Content Expressions (C.E.) associated with the propositions assumed during the intervention (e.g., asserted or conceded propositions).
    ◦ A critical aspect of C.S. management is retraction: C.E.s corresponding to affirmations of factual propositions are erased if their negations are now conceded by the locutor (modeling a formal change of mind regarding that factual proposition).
The Role of Content Expressions (C.E.)
The Commitment State (B) stores the material content—the propositions and argumentative relations—as sets of designs, termed Content Expressions. C.E.s serve as the structural backbone for logical computation within the framework.
• Factual Propositions: A minimal representation of a factual proposition 'F is the case' is provided by a unique design based on the sequent ⊢L 
F
​
 , where L 
F
​
  is the locus associated with F.
• Inferential Propositions: The minimal account of an inferential proposition 'F implies G' is a unique design based on L 
F
​
 ⊢L 
G
​
 .
Ludics Mechanics for Logical Management
The formal management and utilization of the arguments stored in the C.S. rely heavily on the foundational properties of Ludics, specifically relating to negation, location, and interaction.
1. Negation
The framework formally distinguishes between a positive factual proposition (F is the case) and its negative counterpart (F is not the case). The C.E. associated with the negative factual proposition is the design expressing the logical negation of the positive one.
• For an atomic factual proposition F, the positive design is ⊢L 
F
​
 , and the design for 'F is not the case' is L 
F
​
 ⊢⊢L 
¬F
​
 .
• For logically decomposable propositions, designs reflect their structural decomposition. For example, the assertion that 'the conjunction of F and G is not the case' (located at L 
¬(F∧G)
​
 ) requires specific complex designs involving loci associated with ¬F and ¬G. Notably, the model necessitates multiple negative designs to ensure a strictly commutative treatment of conjunction.
2. Delocation and the Fax Design
The concept of location (locus) is central to Ludics. When a proposition is introduced in a dialogue act, its position in the dialogue must be mapped precisely to the abstract location where it is stored in the C.S..
• This mapping, termed delocation, is achieved through interaction with the specialized fax design (Fax 
ξ,ξ 
′
 
​
 ), which substitutes one locus (ξ) with another (ξ 
′
 ) in a design.
• The fax design is essential for modeling the transmission of information. For instance, modeling a speaker S asserting proposition F and an addressee A conceding it requires a series of delocations: from F's internal locus (L 
F
​
 ) in S's C.S. to the dialogue locus (ξ.1.1), and then using a Fax interaction to transfer F's C.E. to A's C.S. (locus ρ), formalizing A's appropriation of the proposition.
3. Interaction within the Commitment State
The power of this argumentative framework is realized through the interaction operation applied to the designs stored within the C.S..
• All possible logical combinations between C.E.s are possible, provided that appropriate delocations are used.
• The outcomes of these interactions result in normal forms, which themselves are integrated into the C.S..
• This mechanism is the core computational procedure: by interacting designs representing premises (D 
cont
​
 , D 
del
​
 ) with designs representing rules (D 
r1
​
 ), the system performs logical derivations. Crucially, this operation can formally yield a contradiction—as demonstrated in the example of a juridical controversy—showcasing the framework’s capacity to detect and manage internal conflicts derived from the asserted rules and propositions.

Ludics Framework for Argumentative Dialogue


The following report provides a thorough and rigorous re-analysis of Section 3.4, "Towards an Argumentation Framework," focusing on the formal mechanisms introduced to model the dynamic and inferential aspects of argumentative dialogues using the Ludics framework.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 3.4: Towards an Argumentation Framework (Detailed Analysis)
Section 3.4 establishes the core structural model for representing an argumentative dialogue, defining it as a dynamic interaction sequence governed by two dual designs. This framework integrates the dialogue structure itself with the logical content being exchanged, grounding the system in the interaction mechanics of Ludics.
The Argumentative Situation: Formalizing the Dialogue State
The dialogue is represented as a sequential series of discrete steps, where the state at any point i captures the accumulated structural and cognitive commitments of the participants, designated as protagonists S and A.
The formal definition of the argumentative situation (or dialogue state) is crucial for tracking this evolution:
Definition 3 (Argumentative Situation): A dialogue state is a tuple ⟨B 
S
i
​
 ,D 
S
i
​
 ,B 
A
i
​
 ,D 
A
i
​
 ⟩.
The four components specify the accumulated state for each locutor (S and A):
1. B 
S
i
​
  and B 
A
i
​
 : These denote the Commitment States (C.S.) of locutors S and A at step i, serving as the repositories for arguments and propositions.
2. D 
S
i
​
  and D 
A
i
​
 : These denote the respective designs of S and A at step i, which encode the acceptable paths and flow of the interaction.
The dialogue commences at step 0, prior to the initial intervention, where all designs (D 
S
0
​
  and D 
A
0
​
 ) are initialized as empty.
Dynamics of Dialogue Progression
Every intervention produced by a locutor (P 
i
 ) triggers a transition from state i to i+1, necessitating specific concurrent updates to both the designs and the commitment states. The framework requires that the progression maintains compatibility, meaning the result must still be a valid Ludics design.
1. Design Update (D 
i+1
 )
The designs, representing the procedural history and structural coherence of the dialogue, are augmented based on the reciprocal nature of the exchange:
• Interlocutor's Design ( 
P 
i
 
 ): The design of the interlocutor ( 
P 
i
 
 ) is conceptually enlarged by incorporating the duals of the sequence of dialogue acts associated with the current locutor's (P 
i
 's) immediate previous intervention (with the exception of the very first intervention). This mechanism formally models the interlocutor's acceptance of the move, confirming that the dialogue proceeds without divergence.
• Current Locutor's Design (P 
i
 ): The design of the current locutor (P 
i
 ) is expanded by the precise alternate sequence of dialogue acts corresponding to their current intervention.
The fundamental purpose of these designs is to model the interaction. In the case of a dialogue that concludes successfully (is convergent), the locutor who performs the special termination action, the daimon (†), is designated as the looser of the exchange.
2. Commitment State Update (B 
i+1
 )
The C.S. is updated to reflect the material content of the intervention, involving both addition and retraction of argumentative elements:
• Addition: The commitment state of the current locutor (B 
P 
i
 
​
 ) is increased by incorporating the Content Expressions (C.E.) corresponding to the propositions assumed, asserted, or conceded during the intervention.
• Retraction (Erasure): Crucially, the C.S. is updated by erasing designs that correspond to the affirmation of factual propositions if their logical negations are now conceded by the locutor. This models a formal change of mind regarding that factual proposition.
Content Expressions and Logical Computation
The Commitment State (B) is not merely a list of accepted formulas; it is a repository of arguments and propositions stored as sets of designs, known as Content Expressions (C.E.).
The formalization of propositions using C.E. links the argumentative content back to the underlying logical structure derived from Ludics (represented as sequents):
• Factual Propositions: A minimal account of a factual proposition 'F is the case' is a unique design based on the sequent ⊢L 
F
​
 , where L 
F
​
  is the locus associated with F.
• Inferential Propositions: The minimal account of an inferential proposition 'F implies G' is a unique C.E. reduced to a single design based on the sequent L 
F
​
 ⊢L 
G
​
 .
The central mechanism for logical processing and reasoning within this framework is the interaction operation applied directly to the designs stored in the C.S..
• Inference as Interaction: The interaction between C.E. designs (e.g., premises D 
cont
​
 ,D 
del
​
  and a rule D 
r1
​
 ) performs logical derivation.
• Conflict Detection: The result of these interactions, which are captured as normal forms, can formally yield a contradiction. This demonstrates how the C.S. enables the framework to perform critical computations and detect conflicts based on the asserted propositions and rules. The normal forms resulting from these interactions are then themselves integrated back into the C.S..

Ludics Modeling of Juridical Argumentation

The following comprehensive analysis details Section 4, "A Juridical Controversy," which serves as the principal demonstration of the Ludics framework's capacity to model complex, real-world argumentative processes, specifically utilizing an established juridical dialogue scenario previously examined by Prakken


Section 4: A Juridical Controversy
The primary objective of this section is to rigorously account for a legal controversy involving three parties—Plaintiff (P), Defendant (D), and a Judge—using a dialogue model limited structurally to the interaction between the two protagonists, P and D,.
Modeling the Role of the Judge
In this framework, the specialized role of the Judge is formalized by interpreting their interventions as forced interventions on behalf of either the Plaintiff or the Defendant,,. This mechanism models the judicial function of distributing the burden of proof, validating or invalidating assertions, imposing concessions, and implicitly requesting additional argumentative elements by giving the turn of speech to the party bearing the proof burden,,. The Judge's final intervention, the sentence, closes the dialogue by explicitly closing any still-pending branches, thereby compelling the party who possesses the turn of speech but has no remaining available loci to play the daimon (†), thus designating them the loser,,,.
Dynamic Analysis of Interventions (I1 to I16 and J1 to J4)
The source analyzes the argumentative dialogue (Example 9) sequentially, detailing how each intervention modifies the shared dialogue designs and the individual commitment states (C.S.),.
Initial Stages and Contradiction (I1-I4)
1. Interventions I1 and I2: The Plaintiff's initial claim ("I claim that defendant owes me 500 euro") and the Defendant's dispute ("I dispute plaintiff’s claim") each create a unique new locus, L 
1
​
  and L 
2
​
 , respectively,.
2. Intervention I3 (The Argument): The Plaintiff's third intervention provides the full argument, citing rule r 
1
​
  and premises (valid contract, delivery, non-payment). This single utterance is modeled by a unique dialogue act whose ramification is not a singleton but creates four distinct loci (L 
31
​
  to L 
34
​
 ) corresponding to the argumentative elements introduced: the rule r 
1
​
 , the contract, the delivery, and the non-payment,,,.
3. Initial C.S. Computation and Contradiction: This intervention adds several designs (Content Expressions, C.E.) to the Plaintiff's commitment state (CS 
P
​
 ): D 
r1
​
  (the law/rule), D 
cont
​
  (valid contract assertion), D 
del
​
  (delivery assertion), and D 
not.paid
​
  (the fact of non-payment),,,. The rigorous application of the Ludics mechanism demonstrates the logical power of the C.S.: interacting the premises (D 
cont
​
 , D 
del
​
 ) with the rule (D 
r1
​
 ) yields a derivable design D 
to.pay
​
  (defendant has to pay). The subsequent interaction between D 
to.pay
​
  and the design representing the initial claim, D 
not.paid
​
  (defendant did not pay), formally results in a logical contradiction,,,,. The continued dialogue is necessitated by the need to resolve this contradiction,,.
4. Intervention I4 (Concession and Negation): The Defendant's response (I4) is complex, modeled as a sequence of dialogue acts. It includes two concessions (delivery and non-payment), each represented by a pair of positive and negative dialogue acts with empty ramifications, ensuring these conceded affirmations "disappear for the remainder of the dialogue",,,,,,,. The intervention concludes by negating the valid contract premise,. The Defendant's C.S. (CS 
D
​
 ) is updated by acquiring the delocated designs of the conceded propositions from CS 
P
​
 ,.
Judicial Interventions and Burden of Proof (J1, I9)
1. Judge's Intervention J1: The Judge's intervention introducing rule r 
3
​
  (burden of proof for signature authenticity) and a non-debatable premise is modeled as an intervention by the Defendant, passing the turn to the Plaintiff,. This updates both C.S.s to reflect the new rule and the non-debatable premise,.
2. Complex Turn-Keeping (I9): The Defendant's intervention I9 (counter-arguing signature validity and introducing the insanity defense using r 
4
​
 ) is represented by a sequence of three dialogue acts,,,. Crucially, the Defendant uses a negative dialogue act after the initial counter-argument but before introducing the new counter-argument (insanity),. This negative act, expressed by the term 'Besides',, allows the Defendant to retain the turn of speech, thereby depriving the Plaintiff of an opportunity to answer the first point,. The final positive act introduces rule r 
4
​
  and the insanity claim, adding the associated designs to CS 
D
​
 ,,,,.
Final Judgment and Resolution (J4)
1. The Context of Judgment: The Judge intervenes (J4) when only L 
16
​
  (insanity) and L 
91
′
​
  (signature validity) remain as available loci for the Defendant,.
2. Imposed Concessions: The Judge's sentence (J4) closes the dialogue by imposing concessions to resolve the controversy,:
    ◦ Signature: The Judge rules for the Plaintiff, forcing a concession in the Defendant's design,.
    ◦ Insanity: The Judge rules for the Defendant (even if the evidence was inadmissible), imposing a concession on the Plaintiff (represented by (−,L 
16
​
 ,;,normal) in the Plaintiff's design).
3. Determination of the Looser: As the Plaintiff now has the turn of speech but possesses no more available loci, the Plaintiff is structurally obliged to play the daimon (†), thus becoming the looser and having their claim set aside,.
4. Logical Contradiction Eliminated: The judicial decision is formally reflected in the C.S. updates. By accepting the insanity defense, the Judge enforces the integration of the insanity design and rule r 
4
​
  into both CS 
D
​
  and CS 
P
​
 . The subsequent internal interaction of these designs results in the conclusion that rule r 
2
​
  (the basis of the contract claim) is inapplicable. Consequently, the derivable design D 
to.pay
​
  (which originally generated the contradiction) is rendered non-derivable, and the contradiction is logically eliminated, providing the formal justification for the sentence,.
General Remarks on the Modeling
The case study validates the Ludics approach by demonstrating that the argumentative elements and their articulations are managed entirely within the commitment states, where computation is performed exclusively through the interaction of designs,,. The sequence of imposed concessions, closing pending branches, formally establishes which party must play the terminating daimon action, defining the loser of the controversy. The judge’s sentence is thus interpreted as the definitive act of validating or invalidating arguments (designs) to achieve a state where the original contradiction is resolved.

In the previous sections, we presented Ludics and the way it may be
used for modeling argumentative dialogues. It should be clear that this
is an ongoing research that changes largely standard approaches to ar-
gumentation, as Ludics changes radically the point of view we may
have on logics. In Ludics, the fundamental operation concerns interac-
tion between objects called designs. Such objects may clearly be inter-
preted in a certain sense as “proofs”. However, two main differences
exist with what is generally called a proof that should be considered.
First, a design may include daimon actions, this allows for consider-
ing proofs and counter-proofs in the same language. Second, a de-
sign may be infinite (in depth as well as height), hence such an object
may include enough information to interact with an infinite number
of counter-objects. We recall also that Ludics is a rebuilding of Linear Logic: formulas may be denoted by closed sets of designs. In that way,
one recovers standard concepts of logics, say truth, proof, etc.
If we summarize our modeling of argumentation by means of Lu-
dics, the dialogue is conceived as an interaction between two designs,
one for each locutor. Moreover, each interaction gives rise to facts,
either arguments, concessions, and so on, that are modeled also as de-
signs in the commitment state of the locutor. Computations with such
pieces of information is also done with the operation of interaction.
The modeling of the juridical example we considered in the last section
follows these principles. Moreover we showed how the interventions
of a judge (and more importantly her sentence) are interpreted as in-
terventions forced for one or the other party. This approach needs to
be carried on to improve the propositions and to tackle in an extensive
way other questions relevant for argumentation modeling.

The reader may find in Walton (2012) definitions for standard terms in use, say
rebuttal, refutation, proleptic argumentation.
2 “compatible” means that what is obtained is still a design.
3Note that an initial claim may also be a negation. There is a difference between be-
ginning a dialogue with, e.g., “Paul did not come yesterday” and saying “You are wrong.
Paul did not come.” as a reply to “Paul came to the party yesterday.”
4The situation is perfectly symmetrical between S and A.

The initial comprehensive analysis of the foundational sections (Abstract, Introduction, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, and 4) has laid a robust foundation for the framework presented in "Argumentation and Inference: A Unified Approach." To ensure a truly thorough and rigorous understanding, this meta-review highlights critical, often subtle, details concerning the foundational logic, the mechanisms of dialogue dynamics, and the specific application methodology.

Rigorous Meta-Analysis of Argumentation and Inference: A Unified Approach

This detailed report synthesizes and elaborates upon the key conceptual and formal details spanning the entire paper, focusing on the rigorous integration of Ludics theory with computational argumentation.
I. The Foundational Ontological Shift: Ludics as a Primitive Dynamics
The proposal mandates an ontological shift away from conventional logical priority, where proofs and formulas are derivative concepts relative to the core dynamic operation of interaction (cut elimination).
1. Interaction as the Primitive: In Ludics, interaction is the primitive concept, whereas formulas and proofs are subsequently retrieved. Designs are defined solely by their role in carrying out this interaction.
2. Loci and Abstraction: The design abstracts entirely from the notion of a logical formula, retaining only loci (addresses) through which interaction passes. This is an essential detail distinguishing Ludics from standard proof theory; the geometry of interaction is paramount.
3. Retrieval of Logic: A logical formula is formally realized as a behavior, defined as a set of designs closed under the double orthogonal operation (D=D 
⊥⊥
 ). A proof is a design belonging to this behavior that, critically, is characterized by the absence of the daimon (†).
4. The Fax Design and Cut: The fax design (Fax 
ξ,ξ 
′
 
​
 ), utilized for delocalization, formally corresponds to a logical cut operation between a proof of a sequent (⊢A) and the axiom (A⊢A). This reinforces the point that foundational logical operations are implemented directly via design interaction.
II. Granularity of Dialogue and Dynamic Semantics
The model substitutes traditional speech acts with the more granular dialogue act (κ), rigorously defined by polarity, locus, ramification, and linguistic expression.
1. Polarity is Structural, Not Semantic: The polarity (ε) of an action (positive or negative) has no necessary correlation with the linguistic form (e.g., question, answer, affirmation). Instead, it is solely a function of who speaks: an act is positive for the locutor and negative (its dual) for the addressee, modeling the latter’s passive role of registration.
2. Ramification and Dialectical Structure: The ramification (I) provides the essential mechanism for governing dialogue continuation by creating new loci (L.i). This permits the rigorous formalization of fundamental dialectical distinctions:
    ◦ Multiplicative Situations: All created loci (e.g., options like "Music or Math") remain available for subsequent traversal.
    ◦ Additive Situations: Only exactly one of the negative actions corresponding to the possible continuations may be traversed, effectively excluding parallel paths within that immediate sub-dialogue (e.g., Yes/No answers).
3. Modeling Presupposition: The decomposition of a single utterance (e.g., "Have you stopped beating your father?") into a sequence of three dialogue acts (κ 
1
​
 ,κ 
2
​
 ,κ 
3
​
 ) highlights the framework's ability to model implicit argumentative structure. The negative dialogue act within the sequence implicitly proposes an intervention to the interlocutor, formalizing the acceptance of the presupposition.
III. Commitment State Management and Inference
The Commitment State (B) stores Content Expressions (C.E.)—designs representing propositions—and serves as the environment where formal logical computation occurs.
1. Retraction as Erasure: The model achieves dynamism without nonmonotonicity by defining a specific update principle for the C.S.: when a locutor changes their mind about a factual proposition, the design representing that affirmation is formally erased from the C.S. if the proposition's negation is now conceded. This subtle detail maintains the monotonicity of the underlying Ludics logic while modeling belief revision at the meta-level.
2. Negation and Commutativity: The framework requires sophisticated design structures to represent logical properties. For instance, achieving a strictly commutative treatment of logical conjunction ('F and G is not the case') necessitates including both negative designs (⊢L 
¬F
​
 ,L 
¬G
​
  and ⊢L 
¬G
​
 ,L 
¬F
​
 ) in the C.E..
3. Delocation and Information Transmission: The fax design is not merely a technicality; it is crucial for modeling information transmission. Conceding a proposition F requires a series of delocations using the fax design to transfer the corresponding C.E. from the speaker's locus in the dialogue (ξ.1.1) to a new locus (ρ) within the addressee's C.S., thereby formalizing the addressee's appropriation of the proposition.
4. Inference Yields Normal Forms: Logical operations (e.g., modus ponens) are performed via interaction within the C.S.. The outcome of this computation is a normal form, which itself is integrated into the C.S.. This mechanism detects and manages contradictions, such as the initial conflict derived in the juridical example (Example 8).
IV. Specialized Dialogical Maneuvers (Juridical Case Study)
The juridical controversy (Section 4) introduces formal mechanisms to model strategic maneuvers and external arbitration.
1. Strategic Turn-Keeping: The Defendant's ability to introduce a second counter-argument (insanity defense) immediately after the first (signature validity), while maintaining the turn of speech, is formally modeled by inserting a negative dialogue act (linguistically manifest as 'Besides') between two positive dialogue acts. This negative act acts as a structural maneuver to block the Plaintiff's response opportunity on the first point.
2. Judicial Modeling: The Judge's sentence (J4) is formalized not as a statement of truth but as an act of imposing forced concessions on the protagonists' designs, structurally determining the final state. This imposition eliminates pending conflicts (loci are "weakened" or closed) until one party, deprived of all remaining available loci, is forced to play the daimon (†), thereby closing the dialogue convergently and being designated the looser.
3. Logical Justification of Sentence: The formal justification for the sentence is provided by the commitment state dynamics: by imposing the acceptance of the insanity design (r 
4
​
 ), the subsequent interaction within the C.S. renders the original rule (r 
2
​
 ) inapplicable, dissolving the previously derived logical contradiction (D 
to.pay
​
 ). This validates the sentence post-hoc via formal proof theory.
The cumulative effect of these details demonstrates that the framework achieves a high degree of integration, where linguistic interaction directly translates into logical calculation, and meta-level concepts (like judicial decision) are formalized as structural manipulations of the interaction game itself.
