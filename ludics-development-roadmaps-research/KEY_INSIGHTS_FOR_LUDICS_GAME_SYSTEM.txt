Key Insights from Girard for the Ludics Game/Arena System
1. The Collapse of Syntax/Semantics
"The ludic programme abolishes the distinction syntax/semantics... my viewpoint is rather syntax, whereas my opponent's viewpoint is perceived (by me) as semantics."

Design implication: There's no external "referee" or "truth" to appeal to. The game itself IS the meaning. This supports your player-agnostic requirement — the system doesn't privilege any particular viewpoint. Each participant sees themselves as "syntax" and others as "semantics."

2. Game by Consensus (No External Referee)
"Ludics closes the window too, by allowing the rule to be part of the game, this is the idea of a game by consensus: the role of the referee is played by the opponent."

Critical insight: The opponent enforces the rules through "dog's strategies" — strategies whose only purpose is to produce dissensus (endless argument) if you violate the rules. If you play correctly, these strategies "nicely lose."

Design implication:

Rules aren't external — they emerge from interaction
Bad moves lead to non-terminating disputes (divergence)
Good moves lead to convergence (consensus)
This is directly applicable to deliberation: an argument is "valid" not because some authority says so, but because no challenger can produce endless dissensus
3. The Daimon and Faith
"The addition of the daimon to syntax by no way produces an inconsistent system... the daimon cannot be created through normalisation."

The Daimon (†) = giving up, conceding, terminating early.
Faith (Ω) = divergence, endless dispute, non-termination.

Design implication:

Terminal positions in our game = Daimon (someone concedes/can't continue)
Non-terminating games = Faith/Ω (fundamental disagreement, no resolution)
Winning = being the one who DIDN'T use the Daimon (didn't give up first)
4. Behaviours and Orthogonality
"A behaviour is a set G of designs... equal to its biorthogonal. G⊥ is the orthogonal — those counter-designs which are consensual with everything in G."

Key formula: G = G⊥⊥

Translation for deliberation:

A behaviour = a coherent argumentative stance (set of compatible strategies)
G⊥ = all the ways to successfully challenge G
G⊥⊥ = everything that survives all possible challenges from G⊥
Closure under biorthogonality = a position that is stable under all attacks
5. Incarnation (The Mystery)
"Given D ∈ G there might be several D' ⊂ D which are still in G; but among those D', there is a smallest one, the incarnation |D|G of D with respect to G."

Profound insight: Incarnation strips away everything that doesn't matter for a given context. The "essence" of an argument relative to a particular deliberation.

Design implication:

Same underlying argument can have different "incarnations" in different contexts
Strategic Landscape Mapping = finding these essential cores
Subtyping/inheritance: "a detailed argument is still a version of the simpler argument"
6. Winning, Truth, and Completeness
"D is winning when it never loses against any E... Truth: a behaviour G is true when it contains a winning design."

Critical:

"It is impossible for a behaviour to be both true and false. But it is not the case that a behaviour is either true or false."

Design implication: Some deliberations have:

Clear winners (one side has winning strategy)
Clear losers (other side has winning strategy)
Undecided outcomes (neither side has winning strategy)
This is NOT a bug — it's the nature of genuine disagreement.

7. Internal Completeness vs External Completeness
"The task is to justify this mathematically, i.e., to formulate a sort of subformula property independently of any syntactical commitment."

External completeness = comparing to external "truth"
Internal completeness = nothing is missing from the structure itself

Design implication:

The arena should be internally complete — all relevant argumentative paths should be present
Proof extraction = the winning strategy IS the justification (no need for external validation)
8. Locativity — Position Matters
"The locative thesis... says that usual logic is wrong, because it is 'spiritual', i.e., abstracts from the location."

Key insight: WHERE an argument appears matters. Two "identical" arguments in different positions are NOT the same — they're at best isomorphic.

Design implication:

Arena addresses encode position in the deliberation
The same propositional content at different loci = different argumentative significance
This justifies the address-based arena structure we built
Synthesis: The Vision for Deliberation-Based Ludics
Given these insights and your preference for Visions E (Landscape Mapping), F (Proof Extraction), and A (Predictive Simulation), here's a unified vision:

The Deliberation Space IS a Ludics Arena
Player-Agnostic Design
In Girard's framework, "P" and "O" are relative — from P's view, P is syntax and O is semantics; from O's view, it's reversed. This means:

One player or a hundred — the system doesn't care
Each participant sees themselves as P (proponent) and aggregates others as O (opposition/environment)
The arena is the same structure regardless of how many actors
Multi-party deliberation = multiple overlapping designs interacting
The Three Visions Unified
Vision E (Landscape Mapping): The arena IS the space. Analysis reveals:

Which positions lead to convergence vs divergence
Dominant strategies (winning designs)
Dead ends (positions where only Daimon is available)
Nash equilibria = biorthogonal closure points
Vision F (Proof Extraction): A winning strategy = a proof = a justified conclusion

Extract the incarnation — the minimal argument that survives all challenges
"This conclusion is warranted" = "this design is winning and incarnated"
Vision A (Predictive Simulation): Simulate disputes

Different AI "skill levels" = different strategy spaces
"If you argue X, opponent may respond Y" = normalizing your design against theirs
Outcome prediction = checking for convergence/divergence
What Should We Build?
Given this, the system should:

Represent the deliberation as a Universal Arena — derived from actual argument structure
Support any number of participants — each sees P/O relative to themselves
Detect convergence vs divergence — the fundamental outcome distinction
Extract incarnated winning strategies — the justified conclusions
Enable simulation — exploring counterfactual paths
Visualize the landscape — showing the topology of the argument space
