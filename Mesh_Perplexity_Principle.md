Below are **12 concrete feature concepts** that follow the *“Perplexity principle”*:
they deliver clear user value, large incumbents **could** build them technically, but **won’t** because doing so would cannibalise—or openly contradict—their dominant revenue engines (ads, data lock‑in, take rates, engagement farming).  Each idea is mapped to a Mesh surface where it naturally fits.

| #      | Mesh surface                     | Feature concept                                                                                                                                                                                             | Why incumbents **won’t** ship it                                                                                                            | What it unlocks for Mesh                                                                          |
| ------ | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**  | **Core feed & discovery**        | **“No‑FOMO Feed” toggle** – switch feed to *strictly chronological* for 24 h, no algorithmic reshuffle, and publish a public hash proving the order.                                                        | Meta/TikTok need algorithmic insertion for ads & sponsored slots; a transparent hash would expose pay‑to‑play ordering.                     | Trust that Mesh is not covertly manipulating reach; differentiates with auditability.             |
| **2**  | **Search / knowledge panel**     | **Ad‑free vertical comparisons** (insurance, flights, banking) showing unbiased real‑time rates sourced via public APIs; Mesh takes **zero affiliate commission** (optionally a flat \$1 verification fee). | Google’s and Apple’s “remunerated placement” pages would forfeit auction revenue; Amazon’s Marketplace depends on sponsored listings.       | Positions Mesh as the “consumer‑first lookup layer” the way Perplexity is for factual Q\&A.       |
| **3**  | **Swapmeet (commerce)**          | **True‑cost stripe** – automatically surface wholesale price, average factory gate price, and platform fee next to every product listing; buyers can one‑click tip sellers instead of paying hidden margin. | Amazon & Etsy rely on opaque take‑rates and ad spend to surface listings; revealing wholesale erodes margins and Sponsored Product budgets. | Aligns with Mesh’s creator‑friendly ethos; users feel in control.                                 |
| **4**  | **Creator payouts**              | **100 %‑pass‑through micropayments** via Lightning or stablecoin; Mesh charges a *subscription* to the consumer, not a per‑transaction cut.                                                                 | YouTube, Twitch & TikTok fund themselves from rev‑share; giving up the rake would gut their P\&L.                                           | Attracts niche creators who resent 30‑50 % platform taxes.                                        |
| **5**  | **Halfway / Maps**               | **Sponsor‑less venue ranking** – distance‑weighted fairness, health‑inspection score, live crowd density; **no boosted listings**.                                                                          | Google Maps, Yelp, Foursquare all sell promoted pins; pulling promotions would cost >50 % of maps monetisation.                             | Makes Halfway the planning tool users *trust* vs. “ads with addresses.”                           |
| **6**  | **Adtech settings panel**        | **“Zero‑shadow‑profile” switch** – store targeting data **client‑side only** in secure storage; Mesh never sees or resells it.                                                                              | Meta/Google’s data businesses depend on centralised user graphs; decentralising erases their moat.                                          | Dramatically easier GDPR/CCPA compliance; privacy zealots become evangelists.                     |
| **7**  | **Node‑graph knowledge posts**   | **Algorithmic transparency overlay** – each personalised path shows *which* signals (rating curve, dwell time, similarity score) moved a node into view.                                                    | Incumbents treat ranking factors as trade secrets & ad levers; revealing them risks gaming and reduces paid‑placement effectiveness.        | Educates power users; fosters a community that improves, rather than games, the algo.             |
| **8**  | **Flowstate (automation SaaS)**  | **Flat‑fee connector marketplace** – third‑party integrations keep 100 % of revenue; Flowstate monetises via hosting tier only.                                                                             | Zapier/Make rely on long‑tail connector mark‑ups and usage metering; giving away connector margin undermines their model.                   | Rapid ecosystem growth; integrators flock because upside is theirs.                               |
| **9**  | **Content moderation & trust**   | **Open‑source policy engine + live logs** – every down‑ranking or takedown emits a signed event to a public log (think Certificate Transparency for moderation).                                            | Twitter /X, YouTube, etc. keep policy levers opaque to avoid legal / PR liability and to retain revenue‑driving borderline content.         | Mesh gains credibility as the *auditable* social network; academics & journalists adopt it first. |
| **10** | **Engagement wellbeing**         | **Hard‑stop time budget** – user sets 20 min/day; Mesh locks feed behind a “come back tomorrow” screen when time’s up (with cryptographic proof it can’t be bypassed without resetting).                    | Ad‑funded giants optimise for *more* time‑on‑platform; voluntary caps destroy ad impressions.                                               | Parents, educators, mental‑health advocates promote Mesh as the “healthy default.”                |
| **11** | **Advertising model (optional)** | **Reverse auction for attention** – users *sell* 30 s of their attention to brands they choose; 90 % of bid goes to user, 10 % to Mesh.                                                                     | Current platforms keep >70 % of ad spend; shifting majority to user revenue would collapse their ARPU.                                      | Aligns incentives; shows Mesh can still make money while being user‑centric.                      |
| **12** | **Data portability**             | **One‑click full export & live WebDAV mount** – users can sync all posts, messages, media continuously to personal cloud.                                                                                   | Lock‑in drives Meta/Snap retention; continuous export reduces switching costs to zero.                                                      | Growth via goodwill; regulators look favourably on Mesh during interoperability debates.          |

### Implementation starting points inside Mesh

| Component                    | Quick technical foothold                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Client‑side ad profile       | Store categories in IndexedDB; serve ads via *local* decisioning Web Worker.                                                 |
| Transparency overlay         | Instrument existing ranking pipeline to emit feature attribution vector; visualise with D3 mini‑chart.                       |
| Flat‑fee connector market    | Treat each connector as an open‑source NPM package; revenue only from hosted runtime minutes.                                |
| Public moderation log        | Append JSON events to an AWS QLDB ledger stream; expose public GraphQL API.                                                  |
| Hard‑stop time budget        | Global `useSessionTimer` hook gating `<AppShell>`; timer stored in `navigator.storage.persisted()` quota.                    |
| Reverse ad auction           | Smart‑contract escrow (e.g. Base chain) that releases funds on proof of view (zk‑SNARK claim weaponised).                    |
| Live WebDAV mount            | Bundle `webdav-server` in a worker; auth via OAuth, mount at `dav.mesh.io/{uid}`.                                            |

### How to choose what to build first

1. **Low effort, high narrative impact**: *No‑FOMO feed, sponsor‑less Halfway ranking, time‑budget caps*.
2. **Medium effort, ecosystem pull**: *Flat‑fee connector marketplace, pass‑through tips*.
3. **High‑leverage differentiators** (longer build): *Open moderation log, reverse ad auction*.

By cherry‑picking features the giants *can’t* copy without hurting themselves, Mesh can position itself as the *anti‑enshittified* network—earning user trust and press attention disproportionate to its size.
