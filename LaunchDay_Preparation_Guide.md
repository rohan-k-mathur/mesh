Awesome—let’s make your “DevOps / infra / testing” day count. I looked at your Mesh repo so the plan below is tailored to what you’re running (Next.js app, Prisma models, Supabase (DB + storage + realtime), Firebase auth middleware, React Flow rooms, etc.). ([GitHub][1])

Below is a **one‑day schedule (≈8–9 hours)** with **pre‑day prep**, **copy‑paste snippets**, and **checklists** for: security hardening, CI gates so Vercel only ships after checks pass, Dockerization, cross‑browser testing, performance baselines, analytics/observability, and **cost guards** so a \~20‑person alpha stays inside budget.

---

## Pre‑day (do this the week before, \~2–3 hours total)

1. **Branch protection & CI gate**

* Add a GitHub branch protection rule on your production branch (`main` or whatever you deploy) requiring status checks to pass before merging. This is the simplest, reliable way to ensure **production deploys only happen after tests pass**. ([GitHub Docs][2])
* Keep Vercel’s GitHub integration enabled so each PR gets a Preview URL; production deploys happen **only when you merge**. ([Vercel][3])

2. **Create service accounts & test data**

* Create a **separate Supabase project** for the alpha (or at least a separate DB schema). Prepare a seed script you can reset. (You already have `npm run seed`—great. Double‑check it’s idempotent.) ([GitHub][1])

3. **Credentials & environment**

* Inventory secrets (.env): Supabase URL/anon/service keys, Firebase config, any 3rd‑party keys (OpenAI/DeepSeek, LiveKit, Google Maps), PostHog/Plausible (if you choose), Sentry, Upstash. Create **alpha** environment variables in Vercel and GitHub Actions (masked).

4. **Pick your analytics**

* For the alpha, PostHog (events), plus Vercel Web Analytics or Speed Insights for Core Web Vitals is a good lightweight combo (or Plausible if you want “just pageviews”). (We’ll wire analytics during the day.)

---

## The day (one long sprint)

### 0) Kickoff (15 min)

* Freeze features. Create a checklist issue called “Alpha readiness” and paste the checklists below. Announce a **code freeze** during the day except for fixes.

---

### 1) Security hardening (90 min)

**App/HTTP layer**

* Add strict security headers (see snippet below): HSTS, X‑Content‑Type‑Options, Referrer‑Policy, Permissions‑Policy, and a CSP suited to your domains.
* Validate CORS (tighten to your Vercel domains).
* Ensure secure, httpOnly, SameSite cookies for auth.

**Database (Supabase)**

* **Turn on RLS on every user data table**; add minimal policies (auth’d user can only read/write their rows; public read only where truly needed). RLS is your main line of defense and integrates directly with Supabase Auth. ([Supabase][4])
* Review **storage bucket policies**. Your README mentions public buckets and an **anon INSERT** policy for uploads; for alpha, restrict inserts to authenticated users (or a service role via a signed upload URL) to reduce abuse. ([GitHub][1])

**Rate limiting**

* Add rate‑limiting to auth, posting, and AI endpoints. Upstash Redis works well on Vercel and gives you budget caps (see “Cost guards”). ([Upstash: Serverless Data Platform][5])

**Snippet — Next.js security headers (`next.config.js`)**

```js
// next.config.js
const securityHeaders = [
  { key: 'Strict-Transport-Security', value: 'max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload' },
  { key: 'X-Content-Type-Options', value: 'nosniff' },
  { key: 'Referrer-Policy', value: 'strict-origin-when-cross-origin' },
  { key: 'Permissions-Policy', value: 'camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()' },
  {
    key: 'Content-Security-Policy',
    value: [
      "default-src 'self'",
      "script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' vercel.live vercel-insights.com",
      "style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'",
      "img-src 'self' data: blob: https://*.supabase.co",
      "font-src 'self' data:",
      "connect-src 'self' https://*.supabase.co https://*.livekit.cloud https://*.posthog.com",
      "media-src 'self' blob: https://*.supabase.co",
      "frame-ancestors 'none'",
    ].join('; ')
  },
];

module.exports = {
  async headers() {
    return [{ source: '/(.*)', headers: securityHeaders }];
  },
};
```

**Snippet — simple API rate limit (Upstash)**

```ts
// middleware.ts (App Router) or in an API route
import { Ratelimit } from '@upstash/ratelimit';
import { Redis } from '@upstash/redis';

const rl = new Ratelimit({
  redis: Redis.fromEnv(),
  limiter: Ratelimit.fixedWindow(60, '1 m'), // 60 req/min per IP
});

export default async function middleware(req: Request) {
  const ip = req.headers.get('x-forwarded-for') ?? '127.0.0.1';
  const { success } = await rl.limit(`rate:${ip}`);
  if (!success) return new Response('Too Many Requests', { status: 429 });
  return; // continue
}
```

(Adjust by route—stricter for AI endpoints.)

---

### 2) CI that gates deploys (60–75 min)

**Why this works**: Vercel deploys previews for PRs; **production deploys happen on merge**. By requiring status checks to pass before merging, you guarantee production only ships green builds. ([Vercel][3], [GitHub Docs][2])

**Actions you’ll wire up now**

* **Run**: typecheck, lint, unit tests (Jest), **Playwright e2e** across **Chromium, WebKit, Firefox**, and a production build. ([Playwright][6])
* (Optional) Add Lighthouse CI to fail the PR if performance drops below a baseline. ([web.dev][7], [googlechrome.github.io][8])

**Snippet — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (minimal, Node 20)**

```yaml
name: CI
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: 20, cache: 'npm' }
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm run typecheck --if-present
      - run: npm test -- --ci

  e2e:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: 20, cache: 'npm' }
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npx playwright install --with-deps
      - run: npm run build && npm run start & npx wait-on http://localhost:3000
      - run: npx playwright test

  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: 20, cache: 'npm' }
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
```

**Snippet — `playwright.config.ts`**

```ts
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';
export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './tests/e2e',
  fullyParallel: true,
  webServer: { command: 'npm run start', port: 3000, timeout: 120_000, reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI },
  projects: [
    { name: 'chromium', use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] } },
    { name: 'firefox',  use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] } },
    { name: 'webkit',   use: { ...devices['Desktop Safari'] } },
  ],
});
```

Playwright supports **Chromium, WebKit, Firefox** (and branded Chrome/Edge), which is exactly what you need for cross‑browser idiosyncrasies. ([Playwright][9])

(If you add Lighthouse CI later, use `lighthouserc.js` assertions to fail on regressions.) ([web.dev][7], [googlechrome.github.io][8])

---

### 3) Dockerization (45–60 min)

Even though Vercel won’t run your Docker image, having a **prod‑like container** helps reproducibility and future hosting options.

**Snippet — multi‑stage Dockerfile (Next.js / Node 20)**

```Dockerfile
# 1) deps
FROM node:20-alpine AS deps
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json package-lock.json* ./
RUN npm ci

# 2) builder
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
ENV NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
RUN npm run build

# 3) runner (non-root)
FROM node:20-alpine AS runner
WORKDIR /app
ENV NODE_ENV=production NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
RUN addgroup -S nextjs && adduser -S nextjs -G nextjs
COPY --from=builder /app/.next ./.next
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
COPY package.json ./
USER nextjs
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npx","next","start","-p","3000"]
```

**Optional `docker-compose.yml`** for local: run app + a local Redis (rate limiting) if you want to test without Upstash.

---

### 4) Cross‑browser + device checks (45 min)

* Run **Playwright** across Chromium/WebKit/Firefox in CI and locally (already wired).
* **Manual sanity** on iOS Safari and Android Chrome (one pass through login, room join, create a node, upload).
* Log any layout issues; fix with conditional CSS if needed. (Playwright WebKit catches most Safari quirks.) ([Playwright][9])

---

### 5) Performance baseline (45–60 min)

* Add **Lighthouse CI** with modest thresholds to start (e.g., perf ≥ 80, a11y ≥ 90) and **budgets** for JS/CSS size. This can run against the local server in CI. ([GitHub][10], [web.dev][7], [googlechrome.github.io][8])

**Snippet — `lighthouserc.js` (very small example)**

```js
module.exports = {
  ci: {
    collect: { startServerCommand: 'npm run start', url: ['http://localhost:3000'] },
    assert: {
      assertions: {
        'categories:performance': ['error', { minScore: 0.8 }],
        'categories:accessibility': ['warn', { minScore: 0.9 }],
      },
    },
    upload: { target: 'temporary-public-storage' },
  },
};
```

---

### 6) Analytics & monitoring (45 min)

* **PostHog** (or Plausible) for product analytics: page views, sign‑up, room join, node create, livechat send, upload.
* **Vercel Web Analytics / Speed Insights** for CWV.
* **Sentry** for error monitoring (client + server).
* Turn on **Vercel log drains** later if needed; for alpha, Vercel logs are usually enough.

---

### 7) Cost guards (60 min)

Your risk is API‑misuse and unexpected spikes. Add **hard/soft caps** where possible and light app‑level throttles.

* **Supabase**: Enable the **Spend Cap** (Pro plan) in **Cost Control** so projects won’t exceed quota without you opting in. Understand this can cause read‑only/unresponsive state when you hit the cap—acceptable for a 20‑user alpha. Monitor usage in dashboard. ([Supabase][11])
* **Vercel**: Set **Spend Management** with a small cap (e.g., \$20–\$30) and auto‑pause on cap; enable notifications at 50/75/100%. ([Vercel][12])
* **Upstash (rate limiting)**: choose **fixed budget** or **pay‑as‑you‑go** with a monthly cap; even the free tier (500k commands) can be enough for 20 testers if your limits are conservative. ([Upstash: Serverless Data Platform][5])
* **Google APIs (Maps, etc.) / Firebase**: set **GCP Budgets + alerts** for the project (email and, if you like, Pub/Sub webhooks). ([Google Cloud][13], [Firebase][14])
* **OpenAI/other LLMs**: set **usage limits** in your account settings and enforce **per‑user throttles in code** (rate limit + max daily tokens). (Limits UI: “Billing → Limits”.) ([OpenAI Platform][15])
* **LiveKit (if used)**: know API rate limits and minute/bandwidth metering; for alpha, keep sessions short and recorded egress off. ([LiveKit Docs][16], [LiveKit][17])

---

### 8) Dry run + Go/No‑Go (30–45 min)

* Deploy a PR, confirm CI green, merge, verify **production** deployment.
* Walk the **Go/No‑Go** list (below).
* Invite 1–2 friends (outside your network) to do a **10‑minute** exploratory test and file issues.

---

## Extra snippets you may want today

**Minimal Playwright smoke test — `tests/e2e/smoke.spec.ts`**

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
test('home loads and can navigate to a room', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Mesh/i);
  await page.getByRole('link', { name: /rooms/i }).click();
  await expect(page).toHaveURL(/.*rooms/);
});
```

**Lighthouse CI GitHub Action (optional job)**

```yaml
  lhci:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: 20 }
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build && npm run start & npx wait-on http://localhost:3000
      - run: npx @lhci/cli autorun
```

---

## What this gives you

* **Security**: RLS, sane headers, guarded endpoints. ([Supabase][4])
* **No “red” deployments**: PRs must pass tests (incl. cross‑browser) before merging to production. ([GitHub Docs][2])
* **Reproducibility**: a working Docker image.
* **Performance floor**: an enforced Lighthouse baseline. ([web.dev][7])
* **Observability**: analytics + errors wired from day one.
* **Cost safety**: hard/soft caps on Supabase, Vercel, and your rate limiter; budgets on GCP; usage caps for LLMs. ([Supabase][11], [Vercel][12], [Upstash: Serverless Data Platform][5], [Google Cloud][13], [OpenAI Platform][15])
