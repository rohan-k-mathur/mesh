# Community Defense Menu - Refactored User Flow

**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Status**: Refactored - Separated from AttackMenuProV2

---

## Overview

The Community Defense feature has been separated into its own dedicated component and workflow, distinct from the formal attack system. This provides a cleaner, more intuitive user experience.

---

## Architecture Changes

### Before (v1.0)
- **Single Modal**: AttackMenuProV2 with 3 tabs (Attacks, CQs, Community)
- **Mixed Concerns**: Formal attacks and community defense in same interface
- **Tab Navigation**: Users had to switch tabs to access community features

### After (v2.0 - Current)
- **Separate Components**: 
  - `AttackMenuProV2` â†’ Formal attacks only (no tabs)
  - `CommunityDefenseMenu` â†’ Community defense (dedicated modal)
- **Side-by-Side Buttons**: Both buttons appear in argument rows
- **Clear Separation**: Attacking vs. Defending are distinct actions

---

## Component Structure

### CommunityDefenseMenu
**Location**: `components/agora/CommunityDefenseMenu.tsx`

**Features**:
- Dedicated modal for community defense
- Green/emerald theme (vs. red for attacks)
- Shield icon (vs. Swords for attacks)
- Badge showing pending response count
- "Help Defend This Argument" button
- Community responses list
- Opens NonCanonicalResponseForm in nested modal

**Integration Points**:
```tsx
// In AIFArgumentsListPro.tsx
<AttackMenuProV2 ... />
<CommunityDefenseMenu ... />
```

---

## User Flow

### 1. Entry Point
**Location**: Argument row in AIFArgumentsListPro

**Buttons**:
- **"Challenge Argument"** (Red/Rose, Swords icon) â†’ Formal attacks
- **"Community Defense"** (Green/Emerald, Shield icon) â†’ Community responses

### 2. Community Defense Modal

**Header**:
- Shield icon
- "Community Defense" title
- Description: "Help defend this argument by providing responses..."

**Content**:
- **Target Summary Card**: Shows the argument being defended
- **Contribute Section**: Prominent "Help Defend" button
- **Community Responses List**: All submissions (pending/approved/rejected)

### 3. Submit Response Flow
1. Click "Help Defend This Argument"
2. NonCanonicalResponseForm modal opens
3. Select response type (Grounds Response, Challenge Response, etc.)
4. Write response
5. Submit â†’ Pending approval
6. Returns to community list showing new submission

---

## Technical Fixes Applied

### 1. Prisma Enum Casting Error
**Problem**: 
```
ERROR: operator does not exist: "MoveType" = text
```

**Solution**:
Changed from:
```typescript
${moveType}::"MoveType"
```

To:
```typescript
CAST(${moveType} AS "MoveType")
```

**Location**: `app/api/non-canonical/submit/route.ts` line 147

### 2. Testing Mode Bypass
**Feature**: Skip ownership check when `DIALOGUE_TESTING_MODE=true`

**Usage**:
```bash
# In .env
DIALOGUE_TESTING_MODE=true
```

Allows testing full flow from a single user account.

## Visual Design

### Color Scheme

| Element | Color | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Button Background | `from-emerald-500 to-teal-600` | Primary action |
| Button Hover | `from-emerald-600 to-teal-700` | Interactive state |
| Modal Header BG | `from-emerald-50 to-teal-100` | Themed container |
| Icon Color | `text-emerald-700` | Accent color |
| Border | `border-emerald-200` | Subtle definition |

### Icon System
- **Shield**: Protection/defense metaphor
- **Users**: Community collaboration
- **Target**: Argument being defended

---

## Next Steps: Clarification Requests Integration

### Current State
- **Models Exist**: `ClarificationRequest` in schema
- **API Endpoints**: `/api/non-canonical/clarification/*` implemented
- **Components**: `ClarificationRequestButton` created but not integrated

### Integration Options

#### Option A: Embedded in CommunityDefenseMenu
**Pros**:
- Single place for all community contributions
- Natural workflow: view responses â†’ request clarification
- Keeps defense modal as central hub

**Implementation**:
```tsx
// Add to CommunityDefenseMenu
<div className="space-y-4">
  {/* Help Defend Button */}
  <button onClick={() => setHelpDefendOpen(true)}>
    Help Defend This Argument
  </button>
  
  {/* NEW: Request Clarification Button */}
  <ClarificationRequestButton
    deliberationId={deliberationId}
    targetType="argument"
    targetId={target.id}
  />
  
  {/* Community Responses */}
  <CommunityResponsesTab ... />
  
  {/* NEW: Clarification Requests List */}
  <ClarificationRequestsList ... />
</div>
```

#### Option B: Separate Clarification Menu
**Pros**:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Dedicated UI for Q&A flow
- Could be used for claims, arguments, premises separately

**Implementation**:
```tsx
// New component: ClarificationMenu.tsx
// New button in argument rows
<AttackMenuProV2 ... />
<CommunityDefenseMenu ... />
<ClarificationMenu ... />
```

#### Option C: Context Menu (Recommended)
**Pros**:
- Most flexible
- Doesn't clutter button row
- Can add more actions later

**Implementation**:
```tsx
// Add dropdown menu to argument card
<DropdownMenu>
  <DropdownMenuItem onClick={openAttackMenu}>
    Challenge Argument
  </DropdownMenuItem>
  <DropdownMenuItem onClick={openCommunityDefense}>
    Community Defense
  </DropdownMenuItem>
  <DropdownMenuItem onClick={openClarificationRequest}>
    Request Clarification
  </DropdownMenuItem>
</DropdownMenu>
```

### Recommended Approach: Hybrid

**Phase 1** (Quick Win):
- Add `ClarificationRequestButton` to CommunityDefenseMenu
- Show clarification requests in same modal as community responses
- Simple tabs or accordion: "Responses" | "Clarifications"

**Phase 2** (Polish):
- Create dedicated `ClarificationMenu` component
- Add as third button in argument row
- Richer UI: threaded conversations, mark as answered, etc.

## Clarification Request Workflow Design

### User Journey
1. **Discovery**: User reads argument, has question
2. **Request**: Click "Request Clarification"
3. **Modal Opens**: Simple form with:
   - Question text area
   - Context (which part is unclear: conclusion, premise, warrant)
   - Submit button
4. **Notification**: Author notified of new clarification request
5. **Author Response**:
   - Sees pending requests in CommunityDefenseMenu or separate panel
   - Can answer directly (becomes canonical clarification)
   - Or approve community member's answer
6. **Resolution**: Question marked as answered, shows in thread

### UI Components Needed
- [x] `ClarificationRequestButton` (exists)
- [ ] `ClarificationRequestForm` (modal for submitting)
- [ ] `ClarificationRequestsList` (shows all requests)
- [ ] `ClarificationRequestCard` (individual request with answers)
- [ ] `ClarificationAnswerForm` (author/community can answer)

### Data Flow
```
User â†’ ClarificationRequestButton
     â†’ ClarificationRequestForm modal
     â†’ POST /api/non-canonical/clarification/request
     â†’ Notification to author
     â†’ Shows in ClarificationRequestsList
     â†’ Author/community can submit answer
     â†’ POST /api/non-canonical/submit (moveType: CLARIFICATION_ANSWER)
     â†’ Author approves â†’ marks clarification as answered
```

## Testing Plan

### Manual Testing
1. **Separation Test**:
   - [ ] Click "Challenge Argument" â†’ Opens AttackMenuProV2 (no tabs)
   - [ ] Click "Community Defense" â†’ Opens CommunityDefenseMenu
   - [ ] Verify both modals work independently

2. **End-to-End Flow** (with `DIALOGUE_TESTING_MODE=true`):
   - [ ] Create argument as User A
   - [ ] Submit community response as User A (should work in test mode)
   - [ ] View pending response in Community Defense modal
   - [ ] Approve response
   - [ ] Verify response shows as approved

3. **Error Handling**:
   - [ ] Submit duplicate response â†’ Should show error
   - [ ] Submit with invalid move type â†’ Should show error
   - [ ] Submit for non-existent target â†’ Should show 404

4. **Prisma Fix Verification**:
   - [ ] Submit all 6 move types (GROUNDS_RESPONSE, CLARIFICATION_ANSWER, etc.)
   - [ ] Verify no enum casting errors in logs
   - [ ] Check database records are created correctly

### Automated Tests
```typescript
// Test suite structure
describe('CommunityDefenseMenu', () => {
  it('renders with correct styling')
  it('shows community response badge')
  it('opens NonCanonicalResponseForm on click')
  it('refreshes list after submission')
})

describe('NonCanonical Submit API', () => {
  it('accepts valid move types')
  it('casts enum correctly')
  it('bypasses ownership check in test mode')
  it('enforces ownership check in production')
})
```
