## Issues System Integration - Clarification & NCM Review UI

**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Status**: Phase 4 Complete ✅  
**Ready for**: End-to-End Testing

---

## Summary

Phase 4 successfully integrated all UI components with the backend APIs:
1. ✅ Updated **IssueDetail** to show clarification Q&A and NCM review workflows
2. ✅ Updated **IssuesList** with filter tabs for different issue kinds
3. ✅ Integrated **ClarificationRequestButton** into ArgumentsListPro
4. ✅ Created **NCM by-id endpoint** for fetching NCM data

---

## Components Updated

### 1. IssueDetail Component

**File**: `components/issues/IssueDetail.tsx`

**New Features**:

#### Clarification Q&A Section
- Shows question in blue card with HelpCircle icon
- Shows answer in green card (if provided) with timestamp
- Shows answer textarea for assigned author if not yet answered
- Character counter (5000 max)
- Submit button with loading state
- Auto-closes issue when answer submitted

**UI Flow**:
```tsx
{it.kind === 'clarification' && (
  <>
    {/* Question Card */}
    <div className="bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200">
      <HelpCircle /> Question
      {it.questionText}
    </div>

    {/* Answer (if exists) OR Answer Form (if author) */}
    {it.answerText ? (
      <div className="bg-green-50 border border-green-200">
        <CheckCircle2 /> Answer • {date}
        {it.answerText}
      </div>
    ) : (
      <textarea + Submit Button />
    )}
  </>
)}
```

#### NCM Review Section
- Shows "Community Defense Review" header with Shield icon
- Loads NCM data via new `/api/non-canonical/by-id` endpoint
- Displays **NCMReviewCard** component
- Handles approve/reject actions
- Loading states during review

**UI Flow**:
```tsx
{it.kind === 'community_defense' && (
  <>
    <Shield /> Community Defense Review
    
    {loadingNcm ? (
      <Loader />
    ) : (
      <NCMReviewCard
        ncm={ncmData}
        onApprove={approveNCM}
        onReject={rejectNCM}
        isLoading={actionLoading}
      />
    )}
  </>
)}
```

**New State Variables**:
- `answerText` - For clarification answer input
- `ncmData` - NCM data fetched from API
- `loadingNcm` - Loading state for NCM fetch

**New Functions**:
```typescript
async function submitAnswer() {
  await fetch(`${key}/answer`, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ answerText }),
  });
  // Refresh issue, close modal
}

async function approveNCM() {
  await fetch(`${key}/approve-ncm`, { method: 'POST' });
  // Refresh issue
}

async function rejectNCM(reviewNotes: string) {
  await fetch(`${key}/reject-ncm`, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ reviewNotes }),
  });
  // Refresh issue
}
```

**New Effect**:
```typescript
// Auto-fetch NCM data when issue is community_defense kind
React.useEffect(() => {
  if (issue.kind === 'community_defense' && issue.ncmId) {
    fetch(`/api/non-canonical/by-id?id=${issue.ncmId}`)
      .then(r => r.json())
      .then(result => setNcmData(result.ncm));
  }
}, [issue.kind, issue.ncmId]);
```

---

### 2. IssuesList Component

**File**: `components/issues/IssuesList.tsx`

**New Features**:

#### Filter Tabs
- **All** tab - Shows all issues (AlertCircle icon, indigo)
- **Clarifications** tab - Shows only clarification kind (HelpCircle icon, blue)
- **Pending Reviews** tab - Shows only community_defense kind (Shield icon, emerald)
- Each tab shows count badge with issue count
- Active tab highlighted with colored background

**UI**:
```tsx
<div className="flex gap-2 mb-4 border-b pb-2">
  <button onClick={() => setActiveFilter("all")}>
    <AlertCircle /> All
    <span className="badge">{counts.all}</span>
  </button>

  <button onClick={() => setActiveFilter("clarifications")}>
    <HelpCircle /> Clarifications
    <span className="badge">{counts.clarifications}</span>
  </button>

  <button onClick={() => setActiveFilter("reviews")}>
    <Shield /> Pending Reviews
    <span className="badge">{counts.reviews}</span>
  </button>
</div>
```

#### Issue Cards with Kind Icons
- Each issue card shows appropriate icon based on kind
- Color-coded by kind (blue for clarification, emerald for community_defense, indigo for general)
- Kind badge shown if not "general"
- Hover effects match kind color

**New State**:
- `activeFilter: "all" | "clarifications" | "reviews"` - Current filter tab

**New Logic**:
```typescript
// Filter issues based on active tab
const filteredIssues = React.useMemo(() => {
  if (activeFilter === "clarifications") {
    return issues.filter(i => i.kind === "clarification");
  }
  if (activeFilter === "reviews") {
    return issues.filter(i => i.kind === "community_defense");
  }
  return issues;
}, [issues, activeFilter]);

// Count by kind
const counts = React.useMemo(() => ({
  all: issues.length,
  clarifications: issues.filter(i => i.kind === "clarification").length,
  reviews: issues.filter(i => i.kind === "community_defense").length,
}), [issues]);
```

### 3. ClarificationRequestButton Integration

**File**: `components/arguments/AIFArgumentsListPro.tsx`

**Integration Point**: Added after CommunityDefenseMenu in argument footer

```tsx
<footer className="flex items-center gap-2">
  <PreferenceQuick ... />
  
  <AttackMenuProV2 ... />
  
  <CommunityDefenseMenu ... />
  
  {/* NEW: Clarification Request Button */}
  <ClarificationRequestButton
    deliberationId={deliberationId}
    targetType="argument"
    targetId={a.id}
    targetLabel={conclusionText ?? `Argument ${a.id.slice(0, 8)}`}
    onSuccess={(issueId) => {
      console.log('Clarification request created:', issueId);
    }}
  />
  
  <SchemeSpecificCQsModal ... />
</footer>
```

**Button Appearance**:
- Blue-to-indigo gradient background
- HelpCircle icon
- "Request Clarification" text
- Appears on every argument card in the list

**Workflow**:
1. User clicks button
2. IssueComposerExtended modal opens in "clarification" mode
3. Pre-filled with argument target
4. User enters question
5. Issue created, assigned to argument author
6. onSuccess callback fires

---

### 4. ClarificationRequestButton Component Update

**File**: `components/issues/ClarificationRequestButton.tsx`

**New Prop**: Added `onSuccess` callback

```typescript
interface Props {
  // ... existing props
  onSuccess?: (issueId: string) => void;  // NEW
}

// In onCreated handler:
onCreated={(issueId: string) => {
  console.log("[ClarificationRequest] Created issue:", issueId);
  onSuccess?.(issueId);  // Call parent callback
  setOpen(false);
}}
```

---

### 5. New API Endpoint: Fetch NCM by ID

**File**: `app/api/non-canonical/by-id/route.ts`

**Purpose**: Fetch a single NCM with contributor info for display in IssueDetail

**Endpoint**: `GET /api/non-canonical/by-id?id={ncmId}`

**Response**:
```json
{
  "ncm": {
    "id": "ncm-uuid",
    "moveType": "GROUNDS_RESPONSE",
    "content": { "expression": "...", "scheme": "..." },
    "status": "PENDING",
    "contributorId": "123",
    "authorId": "456",
    "createdAt": "...",
    "contributor": {
      "id": "123",
      "username": "alice",
      "email": "alice@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

**Features**:
- Includes contributor user info
- BigInt serialization
- 404 if not found

## Known Limitations

### 1. NCM Canonical Execution
**Status**: Not yet implemented

The approve-ncm endpoint marks NCM as APPROVED but doesn't execute it as a canonical move yet. This requires integration with your dialogue move system.

**Location**: `app/api/deliberations/[id]/issues/[issueId]/approve-ncm/route.ts` line 88

**TODO**: Implement `executeNCMAsCanonical` function

### 2. Notifications
**Status**: Bus events only

Currently emits:
- `issues:changed` when issues are created/updated
- `dialogue:changed` when NCMs are approved

But there's no visual notification system yet. Consider adding:
- Bell icon with notification count
- Toast messages for success/error
- Email notifications

### 3. Assignee Lookup
IssueDetail shows assigneeId as raw string. Could enhance with:
- User lookup to show username
- Avatar display
- Link to user profile

### 4. Pagination
IssuesList loads all issues at once. For deliberations with 100+ issues, consider:
- Pagination or infinite scroll
- Limit param to API
- Virtual scrolling

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Testing Phase)
1. **Manual testing** - Test all workflows end-to-end
2. **Fix bugs** - Address any issues found during testing
3. **Polish UI** - Refine styling, transitions, loading states
4. **Add success toasts** - Visual feedback for actions

### Short-term Enhancements
1. **Implement canonical execution** - Complete approve-ncm logic
2. **Add notification system** - In-app + email notifications
3. **User lookup** - Show usernames instead of IDs
4. **Activity feed** - Show recent clarifications/reviews on dashboard

### Long-term Features
1. **Author dashboard** - Dedicated view for pending items
2. **Analytics** - Track clarification response time, approval rates
3. **Bulk actions** - Approve/reject multiple NCMs at once
4. **Search/filter** - Search issues by text, filter by status/kind
5. **Email digests** - Daily summary of pending clarifications/reviews

---

## Performance Notes

- ✅ IssueDetail uses SWR for caching
- ✅ NCM fetch only happens for community_defense issues
- ✅ Filtering happens in memory (fast)
- ✅ Bus events trigger targeted refreshes
- ⚠️ All issues loaded at once (okay for <100 issues)
- ⚠️ No debouncing on answer textarea (could add for auto-save)

---

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Run full lint: `npm run lint`
- [ ] Test in development: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Verify all API endpoints work
- [ ] Test with real user data
- [ ] Check mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Verify bus events don't cause infinite loops
- [ ] Test with DIALOGUE_TESTING_MODE=false
- [ ] Clear any console.log debugging statements
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Train users on new features
