## Core Concepts

### 1. Non-Canonical Moves

Community members can submit responses that start as "pending" and require author approval:

- **GROUNDS_RESPONSE**: Answer a WHY challenge
- **CLARIFICATION_ANSWER**: Respond to a clarification request
- **CHALLENGE_RESPONSE**: Defend against an attack
- **EVIDENCE_ADDITION**: Add supporting evidence
- **PREMISE_DEFENSE**: Defend an undermined premise

### 2. Approval Workflow

```
PENDING â†’ APPROVED â†’ EXECUTED (canonical)
   â†“          â†“
   â†“          â””â”€â”€â†’ (stays approved, informational only)
   â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â†’ REJECTED
```

### 3. Clarification System

Non-protocol questions for factual details:
- Any user can ask clarification questions
- Community members can answer
- Asker marks answers as "helpful"
- Does NOT create canonical dialogue moves
