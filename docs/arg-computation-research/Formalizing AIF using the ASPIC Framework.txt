Formalizing AIF using the ASPIC Framework

This report provides a rigorous and detailed analysis of the introductory sections of the source document, focusing on the Argumentative Interchange Format (AIF) and its proposed formal analysis using the ASPIC framework.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I. Abstract Analysis (Source)
The abstract immediately identifies a critical lacuna in the landscape of computational argumentation: the insufficient integration between the Argument Interchange Format (AIF) ontology and existing formal argumentation systems with their associated argumentation-theoretic semantics. While computational argumentation has advanced significantly, this source notes that a persistent criticism against the AIF has been its failure to fully account for the formal rigor inherent in these theoretical frameworks.
To address this substantive critique, the authors propose a formal analysis of the core AIF ontology, specifically by grounding its concepts within the structure of the ASPIC argumentation framework. This methodological approach aims to bridge the gap between the AIF's representational capabilities and the requirements for rational evaluation, thereby formalizing the meaning and constraints of AIF structures.
II. Introduction and Context (Source)
The introduction contextualizes computational argumentation as a rich, multi-disciplinary research area drawing foundational insights from diverse fields, including artificial intelligence, law, linguistics, and philosophy. However, the very productivity and diversity—termed its "fecundity"—has yielded a negative consequence: the increasing difficulty in systematically consolidating and reintegrating results into a coherent theoretical whole.
The Argument Interchange Format (AIF) was devised as a communal project aimed at counteracting this fragmentation by establishing a common ontology. The AIF pursues a dual objective:
1. Practical Goal: To facilitate data interchange and support the development and deployment of various tools, such as those for argument manipulation, visualization, and multi-agent argumentation.
2. Theoretical Goal: To furnish a general, core ontology that captures the common conceptual components across various approaches (computational, linguistic, and philosophical) to argumentation. The AIF is explicitly conceived as an "interlingua," intended to act as a centerpiece connecting multiple distinct argument systems, rather than replacing them.
The structure of the paper is laid out sequentially: detailing the AIF (Section 2), recalling the pertinent definitions of the ASPIC framework (Section 3), and subsequently articulating the formal translation functions between an AIF argument graph and an ASPIC argumentation theory (Section 4).
III. The Argument Interchange Format (Section 2)
Section 2 provides a detailed conceptual and formal breakdown of the AIF structure, which centers around the notion of an argument graph. The AIF ontology is partitioned into the Upper Ontology and the Forms Ontology.
A. Core Ontological Distinction
The fundamental conceptual separation in the AIF is between two categories of knowledge representations:
1. Information: Represented by propositions or sentences.
2. Schemes: Represented by generalized patterns of reasoning, such as inference schemes or conflict patterns.
B. The Upper Ontology and Node Types
The Upper Ontology defines the types of nodes that constitute the vertices (V) of the argument graph G=(V,E):
• I-nodes (Information nodes): These nodes contain the content of the argument, typically premises or conclusions.
• S-nodes (Scheme nodes): These denote the application of a specific reasoning pattern. S-nodes are further specialized into three types:
    ◦ RA-nodes (Rule Application nodes): Signify the application of an inference rule or scheme (e.g., deductive or defeasible inference).
    ◦ CA-nodes (Conflict Application nodes): Designate a particular instance of conflict between arguments.
    ◦ PA-nodes (Preference Application nodes): Designate the application of specific preferences.
C. The AIF Argument Graph Structure
The formal definition of the AIF argument graph G is rigorous:
1. Nodes (V): The set of nodes V is defined as the union of all I-nodes (I), RA-nodes (RA), CA-nodes (CA), and PA-nodes (PA).
2. Edges (E): The set of edges is a subset of the Cartesian product of V with itself, subject to a crucial constraint: edges cannot directly connect two I-nodes (E⊆V×V∖I×I). This constraint implies that the relationship between two informational components (I-nodes) must be mediated and justified by an application of a reasoning scheme (an S-node).
3. Connectivity Constraint: All non-I-nodes (i.e., S-nodes: RA, CA, or PA) must possess at least one direct predecessor and one direct successor. S-nodes, however, are permitted to connect directly to other S-nodes.
D. Reification and Evaluation
The abstract nature of the AIF ontology makes it purely a representational language. To derive meaningful analytical results—such as evaluating, querying, or assigning status to arguments—the ontology must be translated or reified into a more concrete language. The objective of formally grounding the AIF in the ASPIC framework is precisely to enable the evaluation of these AIF argument graphs using established argumentation-theoretic semantics, such as those introduced by Dung. This process sets boundaries for rational argumentation, allowing for the automatic discovery of inconsistencies and the assignment of defeat statuses within complex argument structures.

ASPIC Framework and AIF Graph Integration

A rigorous, detailed, and thorough analysis of Sections 3 and 4 of the source document ("comma2010-bex.pdf") is presented below, drawing comparisons and contextualizing the framework using broader literature on structured argumentation.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
III. The ASPIC Framework (Section 3)
Section 3 of the source document lays the groundwork for the formal evaluation of AIF graphs by defining the core components of the ASPIC argumentation framework, which serves as the formal foundation for reification. The ASPIC framework (a precursor to the generalized ASPIC+ framework) is designed to integrate the strengths of rule-based argumentation, tracing back to John Pollock’s work, within the semantics provided by Dung’s abstract argumentation theory.
A. Foundational Components
1. Argumentation System and Knowledge Base: An argumentation system AS is defined to instantiate Dung’s abstract approach. It assumes an unspecified logical language (L) and defines arguments as inference trees formed by applying two distinct categories of inference rules:
    ◦ Strict Rules (R 
s
​
 ): Deductive rules whose premises logically guarantee their conclusion (e.g., standard deductive logic or definitional knowledge). Strict inferences are considered "perfect" and cannot be attacked.
    ◦ Defeasible Rules (R 
d
​
 ): Presumptive rules whose premises only create a presumption in favor of their conclusion, making them fallible.
2. A Knowledge Base (KB) is defined as a pair (K,≤ 
′
 ) over an AS, where K⊆L. K is segmented into three disjoint, ontological categories of premises, reflecting their susceptibility to attack:
    ◦ K 
n
​
 : Necessary axioms (infallible; cannot be attacked on these premises).
    ◦ K 
p
​
 : Ordinary premises (fallible; subject to undermining attack).
    ◦ K 
a
​
 : Assumptions (fallible; attacks on these premises always succeed). The relation ≤ 
′
  is a partial preorder on the fallible premises K∖K 
n
​
 .
3. Argument Construction: An argument A based on an argumentation theory (AT) chains these inference rules into an inference tree structure. An argument is recursively defined through two primary cases (strict, defeasible) building upon a base case (a premise). Key functions extract its structure:
    ◦ Prem(A): All premises from K used.
    ◦ Conc(A): The ultimate conclusion.
    ◦ Sub(A): All sub-arguments.
    ◦ DefRules(A): The set of defeasible rules used.
    ◦ TopRule(A): The final inference rule applied. Arguments are then classified by their composition: strict (if DefRules(A)=∅) or defeasible (otherwise); and firm (if Prem(A)⊆K 
n
​
 ) or plausible (if Prem(A)∩K 
p
​
 

=∅).
4. Argumentation Theory (AT): An AT integrates these components, defined as a triple AT=(AS,KB,⪯), where ⪯ is an admissible partial ordering on the set of all constructible arguments. This argument ordering ⪯ is assumed to be defined in terms of the underlying preferences on defeasible rules (≤) and fallible premises (≤ 
′
 ).
B. Attack and Defeat Mechanisms
The ASPIC framework meticulously defines how arguments conflict, distinguishing between basic attack (syntactic conflict) and defeat (successful attack determined by preferences).
1. Attack Relation (Definition 3.6): Attacks target the uncertain elements of an argument (non-axiom premises or defeasible inferences/conclusions).
    ◦ Undercutting Attack: A undercuts B by attacking its use of a defeasible rule r. This is formalized by Conc(A) being the contrary of the rule name r (Conc(A)∈ 
r
ˉ
 ), targeting a subargument B 
′
  with a defeasible top rule.
    ◦ Rebutting Attack: A rebuts B by attacking the conclusion (ϕ) of a defeasible inference within B. This occurs if Conc(A) is contrary to ϕ (Conc(A)∈ 
ϕ
ˉ
​
 ), targeting a subargument B 
′
  whose top rule is defeasible.
    ◦ Undermining Attack: A undermines B by attacking an ordinary premise ϕ in B. This requires Conc(A) to be contrary to the premise ϕ (Conc(A)∈ 
ϕ
ˉ
​
 ), where ϕ∈Prem(B)∖K 
n
​
 .
2. Defeat Relation (Definition 3.7): For an attack to succeed as a defeat, the preference ordering ⪯ is consulted, except in the case of undercutting:
    ◦ Undercutting: Always results in defeat, irrespective of preference, based on the rationale that allowing a weaker undercutter against a stronger target would violate extension coherence.
    ◦ Rebuttal/Undermining: An attack from A to B 
′
  (or premise ϕ) succeeds only if the attacker A is not strictly less preferred than the target B 
′
  (or ϕ), i.e., A

≺B 
′
  or A

≺ϕ.
3. Abstract Argumentation Framework (AF): The AT generates a corresponding AF, defined as the pair ⟨A,Def⟩, where A is the set of all arguments and Def is the derived defeat relation. This crucial step allows the application of Dungean semantics (e.g., grounded, preferred, stable) to determine the justified arguments.
IV. Analysing AIF using the ASPIC Argumentation Framework (Section 4)
Section 4 details the formal mechanism for bridging the conceptual gap between the AIF ontology and the rigorous ASPIC framework. The objective is to formally ground the AIF in ASPIC, which sets boundaries for rational evaluation and permits inconsistency checking in complex AIF argument graphs. The relationship is established via two mutual translation processes.
A. Translation: From AIF Ontology to ASPIC Argumentation Theory (Section 4.1)
The first translation interprets an AIF argument graph G and its associated set of Forms F in terms of an ASPIC Argumentation Theory AT. Since an AT primarily requires specifying the language, rules, and knowledge base, the translation focuses on extracting these elements from the structural nodes and edges of the AIF graph.
1. Language and Rules:
    ◦ The ASPIC language L is defined as the union of all Information nodes (I) and all Rule Application nodes (RA) in G. RA nodes are specifically utilized as rule names (L 
R
​
 =RA).
    ◦ The set of ASPIC inference rules (R 
s
​
 ∪R 
d
​
 ) is constructed by examining RA-nodes in G. If an RA-node (v 
k
​
 ) uses a deductive scheme, it yields a strict rule; if it uses a defeasible scheme, it yields a defeasible rule. The antecedents (v 
1
​
 ,…,v 
n
​
 ) are its direct predecessors, and the consequent (v) is its direct successor.
2. Knowledge Base (K): The ASPIC Knowledge Base K=K 
n
​
 ∪K 
p
​
 ∪K 
a
​
  is determined by the subset of I-nodes that function as initial nodes (nodes without predecessors). The ontological category (K 
n
​
 ,K 
p
​
 , or K 
a
​
 ) is assigned based on the specific form (axiom, premise, or assumption) used by that initial I-node.
3. Conflict and Preferences:
    ◦ Contrariness ( 
⋅
ˉ
 ): The contrariness relation in ASPIC is established by the presence of Conflict Application nodes (CA-nodes). If a CA-node connects v 
i
​
  (predecessor) to v 
j
​
  (successor), it implies v 
i
​
 ∈ 
v
ˉ
  
j
​
 .
    ◦ Preferences (≤ 
′
 ,≤): Preference Application nodes (PA-nodes) formalize the orderings. A PA-node connecting two initial I-nodes translates into a premise preference (≤ 
′
 ) in K. A PA-node connecting two RA-nodes translates into a rule preference (≤) in R.
This translation allows the AIF graph's structure to instantiate a formal AT, from which the ASPIC arguments, attack, and defeat relations can be subsequently calculated, enabling evaluation via Dung's semantics.
B. Translation: From ASPIC Framework to AIF Ontology (Section 4.2)
The second translation provides a mechanism to represent the formal ASPIC structures back into the AIF graph language, showing how arguments derived from an AT can be visualized or interchanged. This process generates an AIF graph G from a given set of arguments A 
AT
​
  derived from an AT.
1. Node Generation:
    ◦ I-nodes: Consist of all premises (K) and conclusions (Conc) of all sub-arguments found within the set A 
AT
​
 , excluding rule names (L 
R
​
 ). The node is tagged with the appropriate form (axiom/premise/assumption) if it belongs to K.
    ◦ RA-nodes: Created for every inference rule (r) utilized across all arguments in A 
AT
​
 . The rule type (R 
s
​
  or R 
d
​
 ) dictates whether the RA-node uses a deductive or defeasible scheme form.
    ◦ CA-nodes: Created for every pair of formulas (ϕ,ψ) appearing in the argument conclusions or premises where one is the contrary of the other (ϕ∈ 
ψ
ˉ
​
 ).
    ◦ PA-nodes: Created for every premise preference pair (≤ 
′
 ) and every rule preference pair (≤) that is utilized by the arguments in A 
AT
​
 .
2. Edge Generation (E): The edges formally define the inferential and relational connections:
    ◦ Inferential Links: Edges connect antecedent I-nodes to the corresponding RA-node, and from the RA-node to the consequent I-node.
    ◦ Chained Rules (RA to RA): If the conclusion of one rule (r) names another rule (r 
′
 ), an edge connects the RA-node corresponding to r to the RA-node corresponding to r 
′
 .
    ◦ Conflict Links (I/RA to CA/PA): Edges connect I-nodes or RA-nodes (representing ϕ) to a CA-node or PA-node, which in turn links to the I-node or RA-node representing the target (ψ). This structure formalizes attacks (via CA-nodes) or preferences (via PA-nodes). Notably, an undercutter argument's conclusion (I-node) links to a CA-node, which then links to the targeted RA-node.
This comprehensive process ensures a formalized, bidirectional mapping between the descriptive AIF language and the prescriptive, computational ASPIC framework, realizing the theoretical aim of integrating diverse argumentation results.


In this paper we have shown how argument graphs as defined by the AIF can be formally
grounded in the ASPIC argumentation framework. We have given the AIF ontology a
sound formal basis and demonstrated how a formal framework can aid in tracing possible
inconsistencies in a graph. Because of the formal scope of the ASPIC framework, we
have also implicitly shown the connection between the AIF and other formal argumenta-
tion frameworks. In addition to the ASPIC framework’s obvious relation to (5; 8; 15; 10),
several other well-known argumentation systems (e.g. (2)) are shown by (9) to be special
cases of the ASPIC framework. The connection between the AIF and ASPIC can there-
fore be extended to these systems. A topic for future research is to see what the relation
is between the AIF and other formal frameworks that fall outside the scope of the ASPIC
framework; this would also further clarify the relation between the ASPIC framework
and these other frameworks. Thus, one of the main theoretical aims of the AIF project,
namely, to integrate various results into a coherent whole, can be realized. This in turn
lays a foundation for tackling the practical aims of the AIF work: to build a bridge be-
tween tools that support humans in the analysis, conduct and preparation of arguments,
and the techniques and systems developed in formal computer science for reasoning with
and reasoning about arguments. By building this bridge, we hope ultimately to be able to
support improved human argumentation.
The paper shows that a relatively simple AIF argument graph contains enough infor-
mation for a complex formal framework such as ASPIC to work with. Information that
is not contained in the graph, such as defeat relations, can be calculated from the graph
as desired. This conforms to the central aim of the AIF project: the AIF is intended as a
language for expressing arguments rather than a language for, for example, evaluating or
visualizing arguments. That said, the discussion on what should be explicitly represented
in the graph and what should count as a calculated property is by no means settled. In this
regard, it would be interesting to explore how and if the AIF can be directly connected
to abstract argumentation frameworks, which have the notion of argument as one of its
basic components. One possibility is to introduce new nodes – A-nodes perhaps – which
link to all the components (I-nodes, RA-nodes, etc.) from which the argument is com-
posed. An implementation of this idea has been trialled in a tool for computing accept-
ability semantics.2 One problem, however, is how to characterize A-nodes precisely –
they seem to have some of the character of an I-node, but on the other hand, could be in-
terpreted just as sets of properties of other nodes. Given both these ontological problems
and further challenges in implementation we currently leave A-nodes to future work.
Some properties of argumentation represented in an AIF graph cannot be expressed
in the ASPIC framework, in particular reasons for contrariness relations and preferences.
Some of these shortcomings are being addressed: (7) present an extension of the AS-
PIC system along the lines of (6), in which attacks on attacks can be modelled with ar-
guments about preference relations between premises or defeasible inference rules. In
an AIF graph, such arguments about preference statements are represented as PA-nodes
supported by I-nodes through RA-nodes. In our future work we intend to fully develop
these ideas so as to keep the translation functions between the AIF and ASPIC up-to-date
with new versions of the ASPIC framework.
