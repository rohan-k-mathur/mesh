Here’s a clear, prioritized set of notes on “Defining the structure of arguments with AI models of argumentation” (Bin Wei & Henry Prakken). I highlight what changes relative to the traditional (Walton/Freeman) view, how the paper uses ASPIC+ to sharpen definitions, and what to remember. 

paper_16

TL;DR (one minute)

The paper formalizes the standard informal taxonomy of argument structures (single, linked, convergent, divergent, serial, complex) using a simplified ASPIC+ framework. Two payoffs:

It completes the taxonomy and clarifies ambiguities;

It shows convergent and divergent are not types of single arguments but types of argument structures (sets of arguments).
It also argues that Vorobej’s “hybrid arguments” are not needed once we distinguish defeasible vs. strict support in ASPIC+. 

paper_16

Why this paper matters

Informal diagrams often blur what is one argument vs. what is a structure of multiple arguments. The authors use ASPIC+ (structured arguments with strict/defeasible rules and three attack types) to separate the two levels rigorously and to resolve the “hybrid” category proposed by Vorobej. 

paper_16

Background: the “standard approach” and its limits

Standard categories (Thomas → Walton/Freeman): single, convergent, linked, serial, divergent, complex (see the six diagrams in Figure 1, p. 2). These are defined informally in terms of how premises relate to conclusions. 

paper_16

Problem: This taxonomy mixes up (i) types of individual arguments with (ii) structures made of several arguments; it is incomplete and ambiguous about relevance and dependency among premises. 

paper_16

The ASPIC+ toolkit they use (simplified here)

Language & rules: a logical language with negation; rules are strict (→) or defeasible (⇒). Arguments are trees built by chaining rules from a knowledge base K. (Definitions 5–8). 

paper_16

Attacks:

Undermine (attack a premise),

Rebut (attack a defeasible conclusion),

Undercut (attack a defeasible rule application). Only defeasible steps can be rebutted/undercut. (Figure 2 on p. 3 shows a full tree A₁…A₁₀). 

paper_16

The paper’s core move: redefine argument types inside ASPIC+

They introduce two unit shapes and then build everything from them (Definition 9; Figure 3, p. 3): 

paper_16

Unit I: one atomic premise gives a defeasible step to a conclusion (ϕ ⇒ ψ).

Unit II: multiple atomic premises jointly give a defeasible step (ϕ₁, …, ϕₙ ⇒ ψ).

Multiple Unit I: a chain where all steps are Unit I.

Multiple Unit II: a chain where all steps are Unit II.

Mixed: contains both Unit I and Unit II subarguments.
Proposition 1: Every argument is exactly one of these types (existence by induction on the number of unit inferences, uniqueness from single top rule / single conclusion). 

paper_16

Distinguish arguments from argument structures

Having the unit repertoire, they define structures (sets of arguments with specific patterns), Definition 10–11; see Figure 4 (p. 4). Key families: 

paper_16

SCS (serial convergent structure): only Unit I arguments; same conclusion. (What textbooks call a “convergent argument” becomes a set of distinct Unit I arguments converging on one C.)

SDS (serial divergent structure): only Unit I; same premise, different conclusions. (Classic “divergent argument”.)

LCS (linked convergent structure): only Unit II; same conclusion (several linked arguments converging on one C).

LDS (linked divergent structure): only Unit II; same premise set, different conclusions.

MS (mixed structure): interconnected set that is not SCS/SDS/LCS/LDS.
Conclusion: Convergent and divergent are structures, not argument types; “single/linked/serial” are argument types (Unit I, Unit II, Multiple Unit I). This completes and disentangles the standard taxonomy. 

paper_16

Reassessing Vorobej’s hybrid arguments

Vorobej proposed “hybrids” where some premises are individually relevant while together they add a distinct line of support (Example F: ducks on the pond). The paper shows hybrids are not a new type of single argument once we separate strict vs. defeasible support and model “supplementation” precisely. 

paper_16

They make relevance explicit:

Defeasible relevance S ⊢~ ϕ (there is a defeasible argument from S to ϕ) vs.

Strict relevance S ⊢ ϕ (there is a strict argument).
Then redefine supplementation (Definition 12): a set Σ supplements Δ when Σ alone is not relevant to C, Δ is defeasibly relevant to C, and Σ∪Δ (strictly or defeasibly) yields C minimally. 

paper_16

Result: “Hybrids” are just structures:

If Σ has one premise (m=1): a Mixed Structure (MS) combining a Unit I and a Unit II argument.

If Σ has >1 premises: a Linked Convergent Structure (LCS) (two linked arguments to same C).
(See Figure 5, p. 5 for worked reconstructions.) 

paper_16

Worked examples (what to remember)

Walton’s textbook examples (Figure 1, p. 2):

“Tipping is bad” with two independent reasons ⇒ SCS (two Unit I arguments to the same C).

“Smoking is dangerous” premise branching to two conclusions ⇒ SDS (divergent structure).

“Birds fly; Tweety is a bird ⇒ Tweety flies” ⇒ Unit II (linked) single argument. 

paper_16

Vorobej’s F (ducks on the pond):
(1) “All observed F’s are G’s” defeasibly supports “All F’s are G’s.”
(1)+(2) “Observed F’s = all F’s” strictly supports the same conclusion.
So we have two arguments to the same C that share (1): it’s a convergent structure, not a new hybrid type. 

paper_16

Vorobej’s G, J: reconstructed as LCS or MS depending on whether the “supplement” is single or multiple—again, no new primitive type is needed. 

paper_16

paper_16

Practical takeaways (for analysts, teachers, and tool builders)

When diagramming, separate:

Type of a single argument (what rules/premise‑combination the tree uses) vs.

Structure over multiple arguments (how multiple trees combine).
Use Unit I/II and Multiple/Mixed for the former; SCS/SDS/LCS/LDS/MS for the latter. 

paper_16

Treat purported hybrids as structural composites (often MS or LCS) once you mark defeasible vs. strict support. This clarifies “relevance” without inventing a new primitive type. 

paper_16

In teaching materials and software, label convergent/divergent explicitly as structures (sets of arguments), not single arguments. This avoids category mistakes in evaluation. 

paper_16

If you only remember five lines

Convergent/divergent belong to argument structures, not single-argument types. 

paper_16

Single-argument types are Unit I, Unit II, Multiple I, Multiple II, Mixed (exactly one holds for any argument). 

paper_16

Making defeasible vs. strict support explicit dissolves “hybrid” as a separate category. 

paper_16

Figures 3–4 give quick visual grammars for types vs. structures. 

paper_16

The ASPIC+ lens completes and clarifies the standard informal model.

Defining Argument Types vs. Structures

(Wei & Prakken – “Defining the structure of arguments with AI models of argumentation”) 

paper_16

1. Big Idea

Use ASPIC+ to clean up the “standard” informal taxonomy (Thomas, Walton, Freeman).

Key distinction:

What is one argument? (its internal rule/combination pattern)

What is an argument structure? (a set of arguments related by premises/conclusions)

Result:

Single / linked / serial = types of individual arguments

Convergent / divergent = types of argument structures

Vorobej’s “hybrid arguments” reduce to ordinary structures once we track strict vs. defeasible support. 

paper_16

2. Argument Types (Figure 3) – inside ASPIC+ 

paper_16

Think of these as shapes of one argument tree:

Unit I

Form: single premise, defeasible rule: ϕ ⇒ ψ

Textbook “single” reason → conclusion.

Unit II

Form: multiple premises, one defeasible rule: ϕ₁, ϕ₂ ⇒ ψ

Premises must work together → “linked” argument.

Multiple Unit I

Chain of Unit I steps only (serial single-premise inferences).

Multiple Unit II

Chain of Unit II steps only (serial linked inferences).

Mixed

Contains both Unit I and Unit II subarguments in one tree.

Fact: Every argument is exactly one of these 5 types (Proposition 1). 

paper_16

3. Argument Structures (Figure 4) – sets of arguments

Now we look at collections of arguments {A₁,…,Aₙ}:

SCS – Serial Convergent Structure

Only Unit I arguments, all with the same conclusion.

Standard “convergent argument” = several separate lines all supporting C.

SDS – Serial Divergent Structure

Only Unit I, all with the same premise set but different conclusions.

Standard “divergent argument” = one reason branching to multiple conclusions.

LCS – Linked Convergent Structure

Only Unit II, all share the same conclusion.

Several linked arguments converging on C.

LDS – Linked Divergent Structure

Only Unit II, all share the same premises, different conclusions.

MS – Mixed Structure

Interconnected set that is not SCS/SDS/LCS/LDS (mix of types or more complex wiring).

Convergent/divergent in Walton/Freeman = SCS/SDS over Unit I arguments, not new single-argument kinds. 

paper_16

4. Where Vorobej’s “Hybrid Arguments” Go (Figure 5) 

paper_16

Vorobej: hybrids occur when

One premise (or set) is already relevant to C,

Extra premises supplement it to yield an additional reason.

Wei & Prakken:

Make relevance explicit as defeasible vs. strict support in ASPIC+.

Then a “hybrid argument” is always one of:

Mixed Structure (MS)

If the supplement is a single premise (m = 1).

Shape: one Unit I and one Unit II argument to same conclusion, sharing premises.

Linked Convergent Structure (LCS)

If the supplement has multiple premises (m > 1).

Shape: two linked arguments (both Unit II) converging on same conclusion.

Example F (“all ducks I’ve seen are yellow … I’ve seen all the ducks …”) = simply two arguments for the same conclusion, sharing one premise → a convergent structure (LCS/MS), not a new hybrid type.

### Argument *Types* vs. *Structures*

*(Wei & Prakken – Defining the structure of arguments with AI models of argumentation)*

---

## 1. Argument *Types* (inside a single tree)

Think: **shape of one argument** in ASPIC+.

---

### **Unit I** – Single-premise, single-step (classic “single” argument)

**Form:** `ϕ ⇒ ψ`

```text
ϕ ──⇒ ψ
```

* One atomic premise
* One defeasible rule to the conclusion

---

### **Unit II** – Multiple premises, single-step (classic “linked” argument)

**Form:** `ϕ₁, ϕ₂ ⇒ ψ`

```text
ϕ₁     ϕ₂
  \   /
   ⇒ ψ
```

* Premises must **work together**
* No premise alone is sufficient

---

### **Multiple Unit I** – Serial chain of Unit I steps

All inferences are single-premise defeasible rules.

```text
ϕ ──⇒ χ ──⇒ ψ
```

* “Serial” single-premise reasoning
* No genuinely linked steps

---

### **Multiple Unit II** – Serial chain of Unit II steps

All inferences are multi-premise defeasible rules.

```text
ϕ₁   ϕ₂
  \ /
   ⇒ χ      θ₁   θ₂
            \   /
             ⇒ ψ
```

* Each step is **linked**
* Entire tree stays in the “linked” style

---

### **Mixed** – Combination of Unit I and Unit II inside one argument

```text
ϕ ──⇒ χ      θ
        \    /
         ⇒ ψ
```

* At least one Unit I and one Unit II subargument
* “Hybrid” **within a single tree**, not in Vorobej’s sense

---

## 2. Argument *Structures* (sets of arguments)

Now: **collections** of arguments `{A₁,…,Aₙ}`, not just one tree.

---

### **SCS – Serial Convergent Structure**

(“Convergent argument” in textbooks)

* Only Unit I arguments
* All have the **same conclusion**

```text
A₁: ϕ₁ ──⇒ C
A₂: ϕ₂ ──⇒ C
A₃: ϕ₃ ──⇒ C
```

* Several **independent** lines of support for C

---

### **SDS – Serial Divergent Structure**

(“Divergent argument” in textbooks)

* Only Unit I arguments
* All share the **same premise**, but with **different conclusions**

```text
A₁: ϕ ──⇒ C₁
A₂: ϕ ──⇒ C₂
A₃: ϕ ──⇒ C₃
```

* One reason branching into multiple claims

---

### **LCS – Linked Convergent Structure**

* Only Unit II arguments
* All have the **same conclusion**

```text
A₁: ϕ₁   ϕ₂
       \ /
        ⇒ C

A₂: θ₁   θ₂
       \ /
        ⇒ C
```

* Several *linked* arguments converging on C

---

### **LDS – Linked Divergent Structure**

* Only Unit II arguments
* All share the **same premises**, but yield **different conclusions**

```text
A₁: ϕ₁   ϕ₂
       \ /
        ⇒ C₁

A₂: ϕ₁   ϕ₂
       \ /
        ⇒ C₂
```

* Same joint grounds, multiple conclusions

---

### **MS – Mixed Structure**

* Interconnected set of arguments that is **not** SCS, SDS, LCS, or LDS
* Mixes different argument types and/or more complex wiring

Example pattern:

```text
A₁: ϕ ──⇒ χ

A₂: χ    θ
       \ /
        ⇒ C

A₃: ψ ──⇒ C
```

* Here: one Unit I (A₁), one Unit II (A₂), plus another Unit I (A₃) to the same conclusion → **Mixed Structure**

---

## 3. Quick verbal hooks (for the slide notes)

* **Types = inside one tree:**
  *Unit I / Unit II / Multiple I / Multiple II / Mixed*.
* **Structures = across trees:**
  *SCS / SDS / LCS / LDS / MS*.
* **Convergent & divergent** live at the **structure** level, not as single-argument types.
* Vorobej’s “hybrids” fall into **LCS** or **MS** once you mark strict vs. defeasible support.

want me to package these as a **Marp/Reveal.js slide** or a **PDF** with consistent spacing? I can also swap `(⇒)`/dashed arrows for `(→)`/solid when you want to illustrate strict vs. defeasible.
