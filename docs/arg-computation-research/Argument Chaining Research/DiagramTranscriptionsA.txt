Below is a clean, structured transcription + explanation of each diagram you supplied, rewritten so that an LLM with no image-reading capability can fully understand the content and the conceptual relationships exactly as depicted.
I break it into five sections, one per diagram.

1. Diagram: “Purposes or Functions of Arguments” (Fig. 1)
Overall purpose:A hierarchical concept map classifying the intended functions of arguments (not accidental effects). It distinguishes cognitive and epistemological purposes, then breaks these down into communicative, self-directed, and joint functions, and finally into specific tasks such as supporting thinking, collaborative learning, coping with complexity, etc.
Top Node
	•	“Purposes or functions of arguments (covers only intended effects, not possible effects)”
This node splits into:
A. Cognitive
Arrows indicate inclusion relationships.
Cognitive includes:
	1	Communicative
	2	Communicative or self-directed
	3	Communicative and self-directed at the same time
Each of these categories then includes subfunctions.

A1. Communicative
Includes:
	•	Reflection
	•	Making a reason for something manifest (Pinto’s primary effect)

A2. Communicative OR self-directed
Includes:
	•	Finding consensus (van Eemeren–Grootendorst 2004)
	•	Supporting thinking
	•	Learning scientific reasoning
	•	Understanding other people

A3. Communicative AND self-directed at the same time
Includes:
	•	Collaborative learning
	•	Structuring collaboration
	•	Evaluating people’s understanding of something (Blair 2004)
	•	Coping with wicked problems
	•	Coping with intractable conflicts
	•	Coping with complexity

B. Epistemological
Shown as a separate branch from “cognitive”.
Goal:
“To justify what is claimed to be knowledge or the truth, both in a definitive and a probabilistic sense, but based on objective truth conditions” (Lumer 2005a,b).

Secondary and tertiary effects
At the bottom, under the arrow “includes” branching from communicative/self-directed functions:
	•	Secondary effects (Pinto)“Relating to attitudes of an audience, e.g., believing that the conclusion is true. They are a precondition for achieving tertiary effects.”
	•	Tertiary effects“Apparent effects of an argument, e.g., confirming the acceptance of an argument’s conclusion.”

2. Diagram: Walton & Bex – Argumentation and Explanation in Dialogue (Fig. 1)
Purpose:Shows the relation between dialogue moves (speech acts), illocutionary relations, and the reasoning structure being built beneath them.
Dialogue sequence (top row of boxes)
	1	Allen: “The warehouses should be preserved.”
	◦	This is an assertion.
	2	Beth: “Why?”
	◦	This is a request for argument.
	3	Allen: “They should be preserved because they are valuable architecturally.”
	◦	This is an argumentative move.
	4	Beth: “Why?”
	◦	Another request: unclear if she wants an argument or an explanation.
	5	Allen: “They are valuable architecturally because the older buildings lend the town its distinctive character.”
	◦	This could be arguing or explaining.

Illocutionary relations (middle layer)
Arrows connect dialogue acts to reasoning nodes:
	•	“Asserting” → creates or places The warehouses should be preserved into the reasoning structure.
	•	“Request argument” → signals Beth asking for justification.
	•	“Arguing” → Allen provides reasons (nodes linked by an Arg connector).
	•	Later “arguing or explaining?” suggests ambiguity in speaker intention.

Reasoning structure (bottom layer)
Nodes:
	1	The warehouses should be preserved.(Conclusion)Supported by:
	2	The warehouses are valuable architecturally.(Intermediate conclusion)Supported by either:
	◦	Arg: argument connector
	◦	Arg/Expl: ambiguous connector indicating an argumentative or explanatory relation
	3	The older buildings lend the town its distinctive character.(Further reason/explanation)

General point of diagram
Walton & Bex illustrate how dialogue moves (speech acts) create and modify an underlying structure of reasons. The same dialogue turn may function as:
	•	an argument (providing a premise),
	•	an explanation (answering a why-question differently),
	•	or ambiguous between the two.

3. Diagram: Mixed Version of the Warehouse Example (Fig. 3)
Purpose:Shows a hybrid argumentative–explanatory chain.
Nodes:
	1	The warehouses should be preserved.← (Arg link)
	2	The warehouses are valuable architecturallySupported by:
	◦	An Arg link from the above.
	◦	An Arg link from the next node.
	3	The older buildings lend the town its distinctive character.Provides a reason to believe that the warehouses are architecturally valuable.
Additionally:
	•	A horizontal Explain link also runs from“The older buildings lend the town its distinctive character.”→ “The warehouses are valuable architecturally.”
Interpretation
The diagram represents a mixed structure where one move serves both:
	•	Argumentative support, and
	•	Explanatory clarification.
The dual links reflect Walton & Bex’s claim that argumentation and explanation are distinct but often intertwined.

4. Diagram: Explanation and Examination Dialogues Combined (Fig. 4)
Purpose:Models the interaction between explanation dialogues and examination (evaluation) dialogues.
Speech-act rules given above the figure
	1	Claim φ – A player asserts φ.
	2	Argue ψ because φ – A player provides an argument using a scheme.

Explanation Dialogue (top flow)
Sequence:
	1	Explainee asks why-question.
	2	Explainer presents story.
	3	Explainee finds anomaly in story.
	4	Explainer explains anomaly.
	5	Explainee accepts explanation. → STOP(terminal successful explanation)
If the explainee is not satisfied, the process diverts into a deeper evaluation pathway:

Examination Dialogue (lower box)
This is entered when the explainee is not satisfied.
Sequence:
	•	Explainee probes deeper: not satisfied.
	•	Sequence of examination moves by both parties.
	•	Examination dialogue successful.
	•	The story holds up or is refuted. → STOP
After this STOP, there is also:
	•	Explanation evaluated.(Final assessment of whether the explanation is acceptable.)

Interpretation
The diagram differentiates two dialogue layers:
	•	Explanation dialogue: provides causal or conceptual story.
	•	Examination dialogue: probes, tests, and possibly challenges that story.
They interlock: if the explanation is inadequate, examination begins.

5. Diagram: Challenger Explosion – Explanation Supported by Evidence (Fig. 5)
Purpose:Presents a causal chain explanation, with evidence explicitly shown.
Nodes in sequence (left → right)
	1	Cold weather↓Contributed to:
	2	Brittleness of the O-rings↓
	3	Boosters burned through↓
	4	Enabled the flames to leak out of the boosters through the seals↓
	5	Allowed flames to reach main fuel tank↓
	6	Challenger’s explosion(Final event)

Evidence annotation
Below the nodes is a box labeled:
	•	“The engineers gave this information”
Arrow links from this evidence box point upward to:
	•	Cold weather → Brittleness of O-rings connection
	•	Brittleness of the O-rings node
Interpretation
This diagram distinguishes:
	•	Causal structure (arrows left-to-right)
	•	Evidential support (arrow from evidence indicating the source of information)
It visually separates:
	•	What caused whatfrom
	•	What supports the claim that this causal relation is true.
