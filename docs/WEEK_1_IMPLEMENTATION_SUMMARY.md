# Week 1 Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### Task #1: Canonical Execution for Approved NCMs
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE

**What was built:**
- Created `lib/ncm/executeAsCanonical.ts` utility function
- Maps all 6 NCM moveTypes to dialogue kinds:
  - `GROUNDS_RESPONSE` â†’ `GROUNDS` (with cqId/schemeKey)
  - `CLARIFICATION_ANSWER` â†’ `GROUNDS` (with cqId: "clarification")
  - `CHALLENGE_RESPONSE` â†’ `GROUNDS` (with extracted cqId)
  - `EVIDENCE_ADDITION` â†’ `GROUNDS` (with cqId from content)
  - `PREMISE_DEFENSE` â†’ `GROUNDS` (basic grounds move)
  - `EXCEPTION_REBUTTAL` â†’ `GROUNDS` (basic grounds move)
- Creates dialogue_move records via raw SQL INSERT
- Updates CQStatus for GROUNDS responses
- Returns canonical moveId for linking back to NCM
- Integrated into `/api/deliberations/[id]/issues/[issueId]/approve-ncm/route.ts`
- Updates NCM status to `EXECUTED` with canonical move reference

**Impact:**
- NCMs are now actually executed as canonical dialogue moves
- Approved community defenses integrate seamlessly with existing dialogue system
- CQStatus tracking maintains consistency with manual moves

### Task #4: Success Toast Notifications
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE

**What was built:**
- Created shared `hooks/useMicroToast.ts` hook
- Added toast notifications to:
  - **IssueComposerExtended**: Shows success/error when creating clarification requests, NCM reviews, or general issues
  - **IssueDetail**: Shows success/error when:
    - Answering clarification questions
    - Approving NCMs ("Response approved and executed!")
    - Rejecting NCMs ("Response rejected with feedback")
  - **ClarificationRequestButton**: Renders toast node for potential future enhancements

**Toast Types:**
- âœ“ Success toasts (green with checkmark)
- âœ• Error toasts (red with X)
- Auto-dismiss after 4 seconds
- Fixed positioning (bottom-right)
- Smooth animations

**User Feedback Messages:**
- "Clarification request sent!" (when submitting question)
- "Answer submitted successfully!" (when author answers)
- "Response approved and executed!" (when approving NCM)
- "Response rejected with feedback" (when rejecting NCM)
- "Review issue created successfully!" (when NCM auto-creates issue)
- "Issue created successfully!" (general issues)
- Error messages for all failure cases

## Testing Checklist

### Canonical Execution Testing
- [ ] Submit NCM via CommunityDefenseMenu
- [ ] Verify review issue auto-created for author
- [ ] Author approves NCM
- [ ] **Verify dialogue_move created in database** with:
  - [ ] Correct `kind` (should be "GROUNDS" for most NCMs)
  - [ ] Correct `targetType` and `targetId`
  - [ ] Correct `payload` (expression, cqId, schemeKey if applicable)
  - [ ] Correct `userId` (approver)
  - [ ] Correct `deliberationId`
- [ ] **Verify NCM updated** with:
  - [ ] `status: "EXECUTED"`
  - [ ] `canonicalMoveId` set to created dialogue move
  - [ ] `executedAt` timestamp populated
- [ ] **Verify CQStatus updated** (if NCM was GROUNDS_RESPONSE to CQ)
- [ ] Verify issue closed with `ncmStatus: "EXECUTED"`
- [ ] Test all 6 NCM moveTypes execute correctly

### Toast Notifications Testing
- [ ] Submit clarification request â†’ see "Clarification request sent!"
- [ ] Answer clarification â†’ see "Answer submitted successfully!"
- [ ] Approve NCM â†’ see "Response approved and executed!"
- [ ] Reject NCM â†’ see "Response rejected with feedback"
- [ ] Test error handling (disconnect network, etc.) â†’ see error toasts
- [ ] Verify toasts auto-dismiss after 4 seconds
- [ ] Verify multiple toasts don't conflict
- [ ] Check mobile/responsive behavior

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Full flow: Ask clarification â†’ Answer â†’ Verify move in dialogue
- [ ] Full flow: Submit NCM â†’ Auto-issue â†’ Approve â†’ Verify execution â†’ Check dialogue move
- [ ] Full flow: Submit NCM â†’ Reject with notes â†’ Verify contributor sees feedback
- [ ] Authorization: Non-assignees cannot approve/reject
- [ ] Authorization: Non-authors cannot answer clarifications
- [ ] Verify bus events trigger UI refreshes correctly
- [ ] Test with DIALOGUE_TESTING_MODE enabled/disabled

## Database Queries for Verification

### Check Executed NCM
```sql
SELECT 
  id, 
  status, 
  "moveType", 
  "canonicalMoveId", 
  "executedAt"
FROM "NonCanonicalMove"
WHERE status = 'EXECUTED'
ORDER BY "executedAt" DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Check Created Dialogue Moves
```sql
SELECT 
  dm.id,
  dm.kind,
  dm."targetType",
  dm."targetId",
  dm.payload,
  dm."userId",
  ncm."moveType",
  ncm.content
FROM dialogue_moves dm
JOIN "NonCanonicalMove" ncm ON ncm."canonicalMoveId" = dm.id
ORDER BY dm."createdAt" DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Check CQStatus Updates
```sql
SELECT 
  cq.id,
  cq.satisfied,
  cq."cqId",
  cq."targetId",
  dm.kind,
  dm.payload
FROM "CQStatus" cq
JOIN dialogue_moves dm ON (dm.payload->>'cqId' = cq."cqId")
WHERE cq."updatedAt" > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY cq."updatedAt" DESC;
```

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Not Implemented Yet (Week 2-3 Tasks)
- Display usernames instead of IDs in issues list
- Author dashboard view for all their issues
- Better empty states for issues list
- Email notifications for issue assignments
- Analytics/metrics dashboard
- Comments/discussion threads on issues
- Bulk actions for managing multiple issues
- Advanced filtering (by author, date range, NCM type)
- Issue templates for common types
- Mobile-optimized UI improvements

### Potential Improvements
- Add undo capability for approved NCMs
- Allow editing NCM after rejection before resubmission
- Show diff/comparison when reviewing edited NCMs
- Rate limiting for clarification requests
- Reputation/trust scores based on approval rates
- Export issues to CSV/JSON
- Integration with external issue trackers

## Files Modified

### Core Execution Logic
- `lib/ncm/executeAsCanonical.ts` (NEW)
- `app/api/deliberations/[id]/issues/[issueId]/approve-ncm/route.ts`

### UI/Toast Integration
- `hooks/useMicroToast.ts` (NEW)
- `components/issues/IssueComposerExtended.tsx`
- `components/issues/IssueDetail.tsx`
- `components/issues/ClarificationRequestButton.tsx`

### Previously Completed (Phases 1-4)
- Database schema: `prisma/schema.prisma`
- 10 API endpoints under `app/api/`
- UI components: `IssuesList`, `IssueDetail`, `NCMReviewCard`, etc.
- Integration in `AIFArgumentsListPro.tsx`, `CommunityDefenseMenu.tsx`

## Next Steps

1. **End-to-End Testing** (Week 1 Task #2)
   - Set up test environment
   - Run through all user flows manually
   - Document any bugs or edge cases
   - Test with real deliberation data

2. **Bug Fixes** (As discovered during testing)
   - Address any authorization issues
   - Fix edge cases in canonical execution
   - Resolve any UI/UX issues
   - Handle error states gracefully

3. **Week 2 Priorities**
   - Display usernames instead of IDs
   - Build author dashboard view
   - Improve empty states
   - Add basic filtering improvements
