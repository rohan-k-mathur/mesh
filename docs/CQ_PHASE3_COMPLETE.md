## 🔗 Integration into CriticalQuestionsV3

### New UI State
```tsx
const [responseFormOpen, setResponseFormOpen] = useState(false);
const [selectedCQForResponse, setSelectedCQForResponse] = useState<{ id: string; text: string } | null>(null);
const [responsesListOpen, setResponsesListOpen] = useState(false);
const [selectedCQForList, setSelectedCQForList] = useState<{ id: string; text: string } | null>(null);
const [activityFeedOpen, setActivityFeedOpen] = useState(false);
const [selectedCQForActivity, setSelectedCQForActivity] = useState<string | null>(null);
const [endorseModalOpen, setEndorseModalOpen] = useState(false);
const [selectedResponseForEndorse, setSelectedResponseForEndorse] = useState<string | null>(null);
```

### New UI Section in Expanded CQ
Added **"Community Responses"** section with three buttons:
1. **Submit Response** - Opens CQResponseForm
2. **View Responses** - Opens CQResponsesList dialog
3. **Activity Timeline** - Opens CQActivityFeed dialog

```tsx
<div className="space-y-2 pt-3 border-t border-slate-400/40">
  <div className="flex items-center gap-2 mb-2">
    <MessageSquarePlus className="w-4 h-4 text-sky-600" />
    <label className="text-sm font-semibold text-slate-900">
      Community Responses
    </label>
  </div>

  <div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2">
    <button onClick={() => { /* Submit Response */ }}>
      <MessageSquarePlus className="w-4 h-4" />
      Submit Response
    </button>

    <button onClick={() => { /* View Responses */ }}>
      <List className="w-4 h-4" />
      View Responses
    </button>
  </div>

  <button onClick={() => { /* Activity Timeline */ }}>
    <Activity className="w-4 h-4" />
    Activity Timeline
  </button>
</div>
```

### Modal Dialogs
Added four new dialogs at component root:
1. **CQResponseForm** - Submission modal
2. **CQResponsesList Dialog** - Full-screen responses list with tabs
3. **CQActivityFeed Dialog** - Activity timeline
4. **CQEndorseModal** - Endorsement modal

All dialogs use glass morphism design matching the form:
- `bg-white/95 backdrop-blur-xl`
- Glass overlay gradients
- Radial lighting effects
- Custom scrollbar styling

---

## 🎨 Glass Morphism Design Compliance

## 🔄 SWR Cache Management

All components properly invalidate caches:

```tsx
// After submission
await globalMutate(cqsKey);
window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("cqs:changed"));

// After voting
await globalMutate(`/api/cqs/responses/${responseId}/vote`);
await globalMutate(`/api/cqs/responses?cqStatusId=${cqStatusId}`);

// After endorsement
await globalMutate(`/api/cqs/responses?cqStatusId=${cqStatusId}`);
await globalMutate(`/api/cqs/activity?cqStatusId=${cqStatusId}`);

// After approve/reject/withdraw
await mutate(); // Local SWR mutate
await globalMutate((key) => 
  typeof key === "string" && key.includes("/api/cqs/responses")
);
```
