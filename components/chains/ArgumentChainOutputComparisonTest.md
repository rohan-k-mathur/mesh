## Arguments

<a id="argument-1"></a>

## Argument 1 — *Argument from Negative Consequences*

![Confidence: High](https://img.shields.io/badge/confidence-High-brightgreen) `inductive`

Rising global temperatures over the past century, particularly the sharp increase since 1980, serve as clear evidence of warming

**Reasoning Pattern:** Argument from Negative Consequences (inductive)

---

<a id="argument-2"></a>

## Argument 2 — *Argument from Division*

![Confidence: High](https://img.shields.io/badge/confidence-High-brightgreen) `deductive`

Human activity is causing dangerous global warming that requires immediate action Climate scientists overwhelmingly agree (97% consensus) that human activity is causing global warming Therefore, Therefore, the conclusion follows

**Reasoning Pattern:** Argument from Division (deductive)

---

<a id="argument-3"></a>

## Argument 3 — *Test Scheme 2*

![Confidence: High](https://img.shields.io/badge/confidence-High-brightgreen) `deductive`

Custom scheme conclusion test.

**Reasoning Pattern:** Test Scheme 2 (deductive)

<a id="argument-4"></a>

## Argument 4 — *Practical Reasoning (Goal→Means→Ought)*

![Confidence: High](https://img.shields.io/badge/confidence-High-brightgreen) `practical`

Agent A ought to (or should) do action X.

**Reasoning Pattern:** Practical Reasoning (Goal→Means→Ought) (practical)

---

<a id="argument-5"></a>

## Argument 5 — *Argument from Sign*

![Confidence: High](https://img.shields.io/badge/confidence-High-brightgreen) 

We need mandatory safety testing for advanced AI systems. Rapid AI capability gains are a clear sign of potential misalignment risks. Leading AI researchers including Hinton, Bengio, and Russell warn about existential risks. This situation is analogous to early nuclear technology requiring regulation.

**Reasoning Pattern:** Argument from Sign

<a id="argument-6"></a>

## Argument 6 — *Practical Reasoning (Goal→Means→Ought)*

![Confidence: High](https://img.shields.io/badge/confidence-High-brightgreen) `practical`

We should increase teacher salaries significantly. Higher salaries will attract better talent to the teaching profession, and better teachers cause improved student outcomes. Countries that pay teachers well, like Finland and Singapore, have the world's top education systems.

**Reasoning Pattern:** Practical Reasoning (Goal→Means→Ought) (practical)

<a id="argument-7"></a>

## Argument 7 — *Argument from Definition to Verbal Classification*

![Confidence: High](https://img.shields.io/badge/confidence-High-brightgreen) `deductive`

There are indeed critical differences between A and B. Doing A is permissible given the norms and constraints of the context C. Therefore, Therefore, the conclusion follows

**Reasoning Pattern:** Argument from Definition to Verbal Classification (deductive)

Test ArgChain 1 Prose

I. Introduction

Test ArgChain 1 presents a structured analysis comprising 7 arguments connected through 7 logical relationships.

this is for testing purposes


The arguments are presented below in logical order, with each building upon or responding to those that precede it.

II. Analysis of Arguments

1. Considering the negative consequences: "Rising global temperatures over the past century, particularly the sharp increase since 1980, serve as clear evidence of warming"

This argument warns of harmful outcomes that would result from a particular course of action.

The argument is supported by 2 explicit premises: (1) "Agent A has goal G."; (2) "minor premise B test"

---

2. Through reasoning from whole to parts: "Therefore, the conclusion follows"

This argument infers properties of parts from properties of the whole. Like composition, it's defeasible because not all properties distribute from wholes to parts.

The argument is supported by 2 explicit premises: (1) "Human activity is causing dangerous global warming that requires immediate action"; (2) "Climate scientists overwhelmingly agree (97% consensus) that human activity is causing global warming"

---

3. By deductive reasoning: "Custom scheme conclusion test."

Detailed description placeholder The reasoning structure involves 2 premises: "Source E is A.", "Source B is C.". The argument proceeds deductively, where the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises if they are true. This form of argument is typically used when natural language guidance explaining when to apply this scheme

.

This reasoning employs the "Test Scheme 2" argumentation scheme.

The argument is supported by 2 explicit premises: (1) "Custom scheme major premise test."; (2) "Custom scheme minor premise test." The underlying warrant connecting premises to conclusion is: "All x are y."

---

4. From a practical standpoint: "Agent A ought to (or should) do action X."

This argument employs practical reasoning, connecting means to ends. The structure is: given a desired goal, and that a particular action would achieve that goal, there is reason to perform that action.

The argument is supported by 2 explicit premises: (1) "Agent A has goal G."; (2) "Agent A ought to (or should) do action X."

Related to this, we note that this follows from: "Rising global temperatures over the past century, particularly the sharp increase since 1980, serve ..." Additionally, In support of this conclusion, we note that this follows from: "Therefore, the conclusion follows"

---

5. Based on observable signs: "We need mandatory safety testing for advanced AI systems"

This argument reasons from observable signs or indicators to a conclusion about what they signify.

The argument is supported by 3 explicit premises: (1) "Rapid AI capability gains are a sign of potential misalignment risks"; (2) "Leading AI researchers (Hinton, Bengio, Russell) warn about existential risks"; (3) "This situation is analogous to early nuclear technology requiring regulation"

Related to this, we note that this follows from: "Custom scheme conclusion test."

---

6. From a practical standpoint: "We should increase teacher salaries significantly"

This argument employs practical reasoning, connecting means to ends. The structure is: given a desired goal, and that a particular action would achieve that goal, there is reason to perform that action.

The argument is supported by 3 explicit premises: (1) "Higher salaries will attract better talent to teaching profession"; (2) "Better teachers cause improved student outcomes"; (3) "Countries that pay teachers well (Finland, Singapore) have top education systems"

Related to this, we note that this follows from: "Custom scheme conclusion test."

---

7. By deductive reasoning: "Therefore, the conclusion follows"

This scheme uses an established definition to justify classifying something under a term. It makes the definitional basis explicit, distinguishing stipulative, lexical, and precising definitions. The reasoning structure involves 2 premises: "By definition, G means having properties F₁, F₂, ... Fₙ.", "Individual a has properties F₁, F₂, ... Fₙ.". The argument proceeds deductively, where the conclusion follows necessarily from the premises if they are true.

This reasoning employs the "Argument from Definition to Verbal Classification" argumentation scheme.

The argument is supported by 2 explicit premises: (1) "There are indeed critical differences between A and B."; (2) "Doing A is permissible given the norms and constraints of the context C."

Related to this, we note that this follows from: "Agent A ought to (or should) do action X." Additionally, Related to this, we note that this follows from: "We need mandatory safety testing for advanced AI systems" Additionally, In support of this conclusion, we note that this follows from: "We should increase teacher salaries significantly"

III. Logical Structure

The chain of reasoning proceeds from 3 foundational arguments toward 1 conclusion. There are 2 supporting relationships where arguments build upon or reinforce one another. 
The logical progression unfolds as follows: 
The analysis begins with: "Rising global temperatures over the past century, particularly the sharp increas..." 
Additionally, the chain considers: "Therefore, the conclusion follows" 
Additionally, the chain considers: "Custom scheme conclusion test." 
Furthermore, the chain addresses: "Agent A ought to (or should) do action X." 
Furthermore, the chain addresses: "We need mandatory safety testing for advanced AI systems" 
Furthermore, the chain addresses: "We should increase teacher salaries significantly" 
Furthermore, the chain addresses: "Therefore, the conclusion follows"

IV. Conclusion

In summary, this chain of argumentation ultimately supports the conclusion that: "Therefore, the conclusion follows"

The strength of these conclusions depends upon the soundness of the underlying premises and the validity of the inferential steps connecting them. The chain draws from 3 independent starting points, which may represent different lines of reasoning or sources of evidence.
