# NLCommitPopover Portal Fix

**Issue**: NLCommitPopover hidden behind DialogueActionsModal  
**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Fixed

---

## Problem

When clicking a GROUNDS move in the DialogueActionsModal, the NLCommitPopover would appear but be hidden behind the modal dialog, making it impossible to interact with.

### User Experience Impact
- User clicks "Provide Grounds" in DialogueActionsModal
- NLCommitPopover should appear to collect fact/rule input
- **Before Fix**: Popover hidden/clipped behind modal backdrop
- **After Fix**: Popover appears on top, fully visible and interactive

---

## Root Cause

### Stacking Context Issue

The NLCommitPopover was rendered as a sibling to the Dialog component in the React tree:

```tsx
// DialogueActionsModal.tsx (before fix)
return (
  <>
    <Dialog open={open} onOpenChange={onOpenChange}>
      <DialogContent className="max-w-3xl...">
        {/* Modal content */}
      </DialogContent>
    </Dialog>

    {/* NLCommitPopover rendered as sibling */}
    {groundsModalOpen && (
      <NLCommitPopover ... />
    )}
  </>
);
```

**Problem**: Even though NLCommitPopover used `z-[4000]` and Dialog uses `z-50`, the Dialog component creates a **new stacking context** that traps child elements. The popover was getting clipped or positioned incorrectly relative to the modal.

### CSS Stacking Context

When an element creates a stacking context (via `position: fixed` + `z-index`), its children can't escape that context, even with higher z-index values. The Dialog's `overflow-y-auto` on DialogContent also contributes to clipping issues.

---

## Solution

### React Portal

Used `createPortal` from `react-dom` to render the NLCommitPopover directly at the document body level, completely escaping the Dialog's DOM hierarchy and stacking context.

### Code Changes

**File**: `components/dialogue/NLCommitPopover.tsx`

#### 1. Import Portal (Line 4)
```typescript
import { createPortal } from "react-dom";
```

#### 2. Return Type Fix (Line 31)
```typescript
// Before:
}): React.ReactElement | null {

// After (allows undefined for SSR safety):
}) {
```

#### 3. Portal Wrapper (Lines 154-164, 290-291)
```typescript
if (!open) return null;

// Ensure we're in the browser before using portal
if (typeof window === "undefined") return null;

const modalContent = (
  <div
    className="fixed inset-0 z-[9999] flex place-items-center justify-center bg-black/30 backdrop-blur-sm"
    onClick={(e) => {
      if (e.target === e.currentTarget && !busy) onOpenChange(false);
    }}
  >
    <div className="w-[480px] rounded-xl border border-slate-200 bg-white p-4 shadow-xl mx-auto">
      {/* All the existing modal content */}
    </div>
  </div>
);

// Render using portal to escape the modal's stacking context
return createPortal(modalContent, document.body);
```

#### 4. Enhanced Styling
- Changed `z-[4000]` → `z-[9999]` for guaranteed top-level rendering
- Changed `bg-black/20` → `bg-black/30` for better backdrop visibility
- Added `justify-center` to center the modal properly
- Added `mx-auto` to inner div for better centering

## Technical Details

### Why Portals Work

**Before (Sibling Rendering)**:
```
document.body
└── #root
    └── DialogueActionsModal
        ├── Dialog (z-50, creates stacking context)
        │   └── DialogContent (overflow-y-auto)
        │       └── Tabs, buttons, etc.
        └── NLCommitPopover (z-4000, but trapped in parent context) ❌
```

**After (Portal Rendering)**:
```
document.body
├── #root
│   └── DialogueActionsModal
│       └── Dialog (z-50)
│           └── DialogContent
│               └── Tabs, buttons, etc.
└── NLCommitPopover (z-9999, independent stacking context) ✅
```

The portal **escapes the component tree** and renders directly under `document.body`, creating its own independent stacking context.

### SSR Safety

```typescript
if (typeof window === "undefined") return null;
```

This check ensures the component doesn't try to use `document.body` during server-side rendering, preventing Next.js build errors.

### Z-Index Hierarchy

| Component | Z-Index | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Dialog Overlay | 50 | Modal backdrop |
| Dialog Content | 50 | Modal content |
| NLCommitPopover | 9999 | Always on top |

With portal rendering, the 9999 z-index works as intended because the popover is no longer a descendant of the Dialog.

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before Fix
```tsx
// Rendered in React tree hierarchy
return (
  <>
    <Dialog>...</Dialog>
    {groundsModalOpen && <NLCommitPopover />}  // Hidden behind dialog
  </>
);
```

**Issues**:
- Popover trapped in Dialog's stacking context
- Clipped by `overflow-y-auto` on DialogContent
- Z-index ineffective due to parent context
- User can't interact with popover

### After Fix
```tsx
// Rendered via portal to document.body
export function NLCommitPopover(...) {
  // ...
  const modalContent = (
    <div className="fixed inset-0 z-[9999]...">
      {/* Content */}
    </div>
  );
  
  return createPortal(modalContent, document.body);
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Popover escapes Dialog's stacking context
- Independent positioning and z-index
- No clipping issues
- Fully interactive on top of everything

## Testing Checklist

### User Flow Test
1. ✅ Open DialogueActionsModal from FloatingSheet
2. ✅ Click a "Provide Grounds" button (WHY move)
3. ✅ NLCommitPopover appears on top of modal
4. ✅ Backdrop dimming increases (black/30)
5. ✅ Can type in textarea
6. ✅ Can click suggestion buttons
7. ✅ Can change owner/polarity dropdowns
8. ✅ Can submit with "Post & Commit" button
9. ✅ Popover closes and dialog remains open (or closes based on onDone)

### Visual Verification
- [ ] Popover is fully visible (not clipped)
- [ ] Popover is centered on screen
- [ ] Backdrop covers entire viewport
- [ ] Backdrop is darker than dialog backdrop
- [ ] No scrollbars appear unexpectedly
- [ ] Focus management works correctly

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Works on mobile/narrow viewports
- [ ] Multiple dialog/popover stacking (unlikely but possible)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape)
- [ ] Rapid open/close doesn't cause render issues

## Performance Considerations

### Portal Overhead

**Minimal**: `createPortal` is lightweight and doesn't clone the React tree. It simply renders the component at a different DOM location.

### Re-renders

The portal content re-renders when props or state change, just like normal React components. No additional overhead.

### Memory

Portal creates a single additional DOM node at the root level. Cleaned up automatically when component unmounts.

## Related Patterns

### Other Components Using Portals

The codebase already uses portals in several places:

1. **FloatingSheet.tsx** (line 144)
   ```typescript
   return createPortal(sheetContent, document.body);
   ```

2. **IssueEntityPicker.tsx** (line 189)
   ```typescript
   return createPortal(modalContent, document.body);
   ```

3. **NegotiationDrawer.tsx** (line 39)
   ```typescript
   return createPortal(..., document.body);
   ```

### When to Use Portals

Use portals for:
- ✅ Modals/dialogs
- ✅ Popovers/tooltips that need to escape parent overflow
- ✅ Full-screen overlays
- ✅ Elements that must appear on top of everything
- ✅ Notifications/toasts

Don't use portals for:
- ❌ Regular in-flow content
- ❌ Components that should respect parent layout
- ❌ Elements that don't need z-index stacking

---

## Browser Compatibility

`createPortal` is supported in all modern browsers:
- ✅ Chrome/Edge 16+
- ✅ Firefox 52+
- ✅ Safari 10.1+
- ✅ All mobile browsers

Next.js SSR handles it correctly with the `typeof window` check.

---

## Future Improvements

### Optional: Focus Trap

Consider adding a focus trap to keep keyboard navigation within the popover:

```typescript
import { useFocusTrap } from "@/hooks/useFocusTrap";

const modalRef = useFocusTrap(open);

return createPortal(
  <div ref={modalRef} className="...">
    {/* Content */}
  </div>,
  document.body
);
```

### Optional: Animation

Add enter/exit animations with Framer Motion or CSS transitions:

```typescript
import { AnimatePresence, motion } from "framer-motion";

return createPortal(
  <AnimatePresence>
    {open && (
      <motion.div
        initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.95 }}
        animate={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1 }}
        exit={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.95 }}
        className="..."
      >
        {/* Content */}
      </motion.div>
    )}
  </AnimatePresence>,
  document.body
);
```

### Optional: Escape Hatch

Allow consumers to specify portal target:

```typescript
export function NLCommitPopover({
  // ...
  portalTarget = document.body,
}: {
  // ...
  portalTarget?: HTMLElement;
}) {
  return createPortal(modalContent, portalTarget);
}
```

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Navigation

- ✅ **Escape** closes the popover (already implemented in `handleKeyDown`)
- ✅ **Tab** moves focus within the popover
- ✅ **Cmd/Ctrl + Enter** submits (already implemented)

### Screen Readers

Portal rendering doesn't affect screen reader functionality:
- ARIA labels still work
- Focus order preserved
- Announcements function normally

### Focus Management

When popover opens:
1. Dialog loses focus
2. Popover textarea gets focus (`autoFocus` prop)
3. User interacts with popover
4. On close, focus returns to dialog

Consider enhancing with explicit focus restoration:

```typescript
const previousFocus = React.useRef<HTMLElement | null>(null);

React.useEffect(() => {
  if (open) {
    previousFocus.current = document.activeElement as HTMLElement;
  } else {
    previousFocus.current?.focus();
  }
}, [open]);
```

## Related Issues

### StructuralMoveModal

The StructuralMoveModal is also rendered as a sibling to the Dialog but doesn't have the same issue because:
1. It uses Radix UI's Dialog primitive (which handles portals internally)
2. It's less likely to be opened while the main Dialog is still visible
3. Its z-index management is handled by Radix

If similar issues arise with StructuralMoveModal, apply the same portal pattern.

### CQContextPanel

The CQContextPanel is rendered **inside** the DialogContent (in the CQs tab), so it doesn't need a portal. It's part of the modal's content, not a separate overlay.

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, revert by:

1. Remove `createPortal` import
2. Remove SSR check and modalContent wrapper
3. Return JSX directly
4. Restore original z-index (`z-[4000]`)

```typescript
// Rollback to this:
if (!open) return null;

return (
  <div className="fixed inset-0 z-[4000] flex place-items-center bg-black/20 backdrop-blur-sm">
    {/* Content */}
  </div>
);
```

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Stacking contexts are tricky** - Even high z-index can't escape parent context
2. **Portals are the solution** - For overlays that must appear on top of everything
3. **SSR safety matters** - Always check `typeof window` before using browser APIs
4. **Consistent patterns** - Follow existing portal usage in the codebase
5. **Test with user flows** - Stacking issues only show up in real interaction

---

## Status

✅ **RESOLVED**

The NLCommitPopover now renders via React Portal at the document body level, ensuring it always appears on top of the DialogueActionsModal and any other UI elements. Users can successfully provide grounds for WHY moves through the GROUNDS dialogue action.

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Test in browser with real deliberation
2. ✅ Verify all GROUNDS moves work correctly
3. ✅ Check keyboard navigation
4. Consider adding focus trap (optional enhancement)
5. Consider adding animations (optional polish)
