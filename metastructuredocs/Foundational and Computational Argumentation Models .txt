Detailed Report on Foundational and Computational Argumentation
I. Review of "Argument-based Belief in Topological Structures"
The work presented in "Argument-based Belief in Topological Structures" establishes a novel framework that integrates epistemic logic with abstract argumentation theory, moving beyond traditional models that quantify belief without accounting for the underlying evidence or justification.
Integration of Topology and Argumentation
The paper builds upon the topological semantics for evidence and belief, where the set of worlds (X) is endowed with a topology (τ), and pieces of evidence are represented as open sets. The topology τ governs the ways in which available pieces of evidence can be logically combined (closure under finite intersections and arbitrary unions).
The critical innovation is the introduction of the Topological Argumentation Model (M=(X,E 
0
​
 ,τ 
E 
0
​
 
​
 ,≺,V)), which extends the standard topological evidence model by explicitly defining an attack relation (≺) over the topology τ. This attack relation formalizes conflict among combined evidence, asserting that two pieces of evidence attack each other if and only if they are in conflict (their intersection is empty), although the resulting attack need not be mutual. This structure forms an attack graph A 
τ
​
 =(τ,≺).
Defining Grounded Belief
To define belief, the framework utilizes the mechanisms of Dung’s Abstract Argumentation Frameworks (AFs) to filter the "acceptable" pieces of evidence. The core definition relies on the characteristic function (d 
τ
​
 ), which identifies open sets defended by a given set T. The Grounded Belief (BP) is then defined using the least fixed point of this function, LFP 
τ
​
  (known as the grounded extension in AF theory), which is uniquely defined, conflict-free, and defends all its members.
An agent possesses grounded belief in a proposition P (BP) if and only if there exists an open set f within the grounded extension (LFP 
τ
​
 ) that supports P (f⊆P). This signifies that the agent has a "good" argument (an acceptable piece of combined evidence) for P.
Epistemological Implications and Closure Failure
A key result of this model is the demonstration that grounded beliefs are not closed under conjunction (Bϕ and Bψ do not necessarily imply B(ϕ∧ψ)). This failure distinguishes grounded belief from many relational and evidence-based notions of belief, making it more akin to probabilistic beliefs.
The authors leverage this failure to address the philosophical debate surrounding rationality. They argue that this lack of closure does not imply the agent lacks formal reasoning abilities, as the topology itself guarantees that the agent can combine evidence logically. Instead, the lack of closure arises from the strategy used to select acceptable arguments (the grounded extension). This result formally separates the agent's logical capacity for combining evidence (deductive reasoning) from the closure properties of the beliefs generated by selecting arguments (grounded belief).
Furthermore, the relationship between grounded belief (BP) and topological evidence-based belief (BelP) is formalized, showing that BelP implies BP (grounded belief is weaker/less restrictive). It is also shown that if the attack relation ≺ is symmetric, LFP 
τ
​
  coincides with the set of justifications (J 
M
​
 ) used for BelP, and BP becomes closed under conjunction.
The logic of grounded belief, ABBL, is characterized by the axiom system ABBS, which is sound and complete with respect to topological argumentation models.

II. Review of "A framework for relating, implementing and verifying argumentation models and their translations"
This thesis addresses significant practical and theoretical hurdles in computational argumentation theory concerning the implementation and formal verification of argumentation models and translations between them.
Methodology: Functional Programming and Dependent Type Theory
The central contribution is the development of a framework that utilizes functional programming (Haskell) and dependent type theory (Agda) to bridge the gap between abstract mathematical specifications and reliable software implementations. This approach contrasts with typical imperative implementations (e.g., in Java), which often diverge significantly from the formal mathematical definition, complicating verification efforts.
Key elements of the methodology include:
1. Haskell Implementation: Functional programming languages provide a declarative style suitable for expressing mathematical definitions closely, thereby simplifying the verification process. Haskell was used to implement both abstract models (Dung's AFs) and structured models (Carneades).
2. Formal Verification (Agda): By leveraging the Curry-Howard correspondence, the framework enables mechanical formalization and proof of correctness within a theorem prover like Agda. This is particularly crucial given the complexity and technical difficulty of proofs associated with translating models, which often require amendment or are hard for experts to verify manually.
3. Testing Tools: The framework uses mechanisms like QuickCheck in Haskell to automatically generate counter-examples to desired properties, facilitating quick initial testing of implementation correctness.
Key Use Cases and Achievements
The framework was demonstrated through several foundational use cases:
1. Dung's AF Implementation: A Haskell implementation of Dung's AFs and their semantics (grounded, semi-stable) was developed, showing the suitability of functional programming for abstract models. This implementation was subsequently formalized in Agda, achieving the first fully machine-checkable formalization of an argumentation model.
2. Carneades Implementation: The Carneades Argumentation Model was implemented, serving as one of the first functional programming realizations of a structured argumentation model and establishing a Domain-Specific Language (DSL).
3. Verified Translation Pipeline: The thesis developed an algorithmic translation from the structured Carneades model into Dung's AFs, capitalizing on prior work relating Carneades to ASPIC+. The key output is a verified pipeline where a Carneades argument structure is translated into a Dung AF readable by efficient SAT-based implementations (e.g., ASPARTIX), with correspondence properties between the models implemented and verified.
4. ASPIC+ Generalization: The framework was applied to generalize the ASPIC+ model to incorporate weight propagation, argument accrual, and content orderings, translating this extended formalism directly into Dung’s AFs.
The framework’s success hinges on providing intuitive implementations that are mathematically specified and formally verifiable, addressing a critical need for rigor in computational argumentation.

III. Review of "Argumentation Schemes. History, Classifications, and Computational Applications"
This comprehensive review details Argumentation Schemes (AS) as the intermediate structures linking philosophical and formal logic to natural language discourse, highlighting their theoretical evolution and critical role in computational systems.
Nature and Structure of Argumentation Schemes
Argumentation schemes are defined as stereotypical, defeasible patterns of inference that abstract the structure of common arguments, such as Argument from Expert Opinion or Practical Reasoning. They merge semantic-ontological relationships with logical rules of inference and types of reasoning (e.g., abductive, analogical).
Crucially, AS are defeasible: their acceptability is tested via a corresponding set of Critical Questions (CQs). These CQs function as dialectical instruments, pointing to potential counterarguments or defeating circumstances.
Historically, AS evolved from the Aristotelian topics, which were concerned with "places to find arguments". Their modern prominence began in the 20th century, cementing their use for analyzing, recognizing, and producing arguments in specialized domains, especially AI and Law.
Classification and Conceptual Challenges
The classification of AS is a complex endeavor, typically involving both top-down (dichotomic) and bottom-up (clustering) approaches. Historical and modern systems often rely on mixed criteria:
• Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca (New Rhetoric): Divided schemes based on rhetorical purpose (association/dissociation) and logical structure (quasi-logical vs. arguments based on reality).
• Lumer and Dove: Used a hybrid of logical type (Deductive, Probabilistic) and pragmatic purpose (Practical argument schemes, concerned with recommending a course of action).
A modular approach is necessary for complex, real-world argumentation, where arguments rely on nets of argumentation schemes—sequences of interconnected schemes—rather than single, isolated instances.
Computational Applications
Argumentation schemes are foundational to several computational applications:
1. Formal Argumentation Systems: AS fit naturally within structured argumentation models.
    ◦ ASPIC+ and DefLog: Schemes can be formalized as defeasible inference rules, where CQs correspond to exceptions or defeaters.
    ◦ Carneades Argumentation System (CAS): In CAS, critical questions are modeled by distinguishing between ordinary premises, assumptions, and exceptions, allowing the system to assign and track the burden of proof.
2. Argument Interchange Format (AIF): AS are a cornerstone of the Argument Web infrastructure. The AIF defines an ontology of AS using Description Logic, allowing for automated classification and reasoning. This formal ontology facilitates inferring appropriate CQs based on hierarchical relationships between schemes, which is vital for designing dialogue systems.
3. Argument Mining (AM): AS are crucial for developing algorithms to automatically extract argument structure from natural language text. Researchers use linguistic features (like keywords and modal verbs) associated with specific schemes to train classifiers for scheme identification.
In summary, Argumentation Schemes are recognized as indispensable semi-formal tools, providing the necessary structural guidance for computational models to analyze, reason about, and manage the complexity and defeasibility inherent in human argumentation.
