# Mesh Digital Agora — Formal Foundations

**Three layers**
1) **Protocol (PPD)** — move legality, explicit reply, attack vs surrender, relevance, public semantics.
2) **Geometry (Ludics)** — loci, polarized acts, convergence (†), divergence, delocation.
3) **Content (Toulmin/Walton)** — schemes + CQs, rebut vs undercut, Toulmin structure, AIF interop.

**Design principles**
- Public semantics only (legality/status derived solely from the public record).
- Explicit reply tree (every non-initial move replies to a prior move/locus).
- Attack vs Surrender classification drives branch state and status.
- Room presets: semantics lens (grounded / preferred), asymmetric burden, strict relevance (opt-in).
